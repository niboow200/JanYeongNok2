# Blueprint Graph Editing Skill

> **Also load `blueprints` skill** when creating new blueprints, adding variables/components, or overriding functions.
> This skill covers **node-level graph editing** — adding nodes, wiring pins, setting values, and layout.

## Critical Rules

### ⚠️ Method Name Gotchas

| WRONG | CORRECT |
|-------|---------|
| `list_nodes()` | `get_nodes_in_graph()` |
| `add_node()` | `add_function_call_node()` or `add_event_node()` etc. |
| `disconnect_nodes()` | `disconnect_pin()` |
| `get_node_connections()` | `get_connections()` |

### ⚠️ `disconnect_pin()` Signature — 4 Args Only

`disconnect_pin` breaks **all** connections from a single named pin. Do **not** call it like `connect_nodes` (which takes 6 args):

```python
# CORRECT — 4 args: path, graph, node_id, pin_name
unreal.BlueprintService.disconnect_pin(bp_path, "EventGraph", custom_event_id, "then")

# WRONG — 6 args crashes with "takes at most 4 arguments (6 given)"
# unreal.BlueprintService.disconnect_pin(bp_path, graph, src_id, src_pin, tgt_id, tgt_pin)
```

To remove a specific edge, disconnect the output pin on the source node (e.g. `"then"`). Because the other end is the only connection on that exec pin, the single-pin disconnect is equivalent to removing the edge.

### ⚠️ Property Name Gotchas

| WRONG | CORRECT |
|-------|---------|
| `node.node_name` | `node.node_title` |
| `node.node_position_x` | `node.pos_x` |
| `node.node_position_y` | `node.pos_y` |
| `pin.direction` | use the pin input/output boolean from `get_node_pins()` (`bIsInput` / Python bool field), not a `direction` enum |
| `pin.is_linked` | `pin.is_connected` |
| `pin.current_value` | `pin.default_value` |
| `pin.sub_pins` | *(does not exist)* |

### ⚠️ `discover_nodes()` vs `get_nodes_in_graph()` — Different Object Types

`get_nodes_in_graph()` returns **`FBlueprintNodeInfo`** objects — these have `node_title`, `node_id`, `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `node_type`.

`discover_nodes()` returns **`FBlueprintNodeTypeInfo`** objects — these have **`display_name`** (NOT `node_title`), `spawner_key`, `category`, `tooltip`, `is_pure`, `is_latent`, `keywords`.

```python
# get_nodes_in_graph — use node_title
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, graph)
for n in nodes:
    print(n.node_title, n.node_id)  # node_title is correct here

# discover_nodes — use display_name (NOT node_title)
matches = unreal.BlueprintService.discover_nodes(bp_path, "Broadcast")
for m in matches:
    print(m.display_name, m.spawner_key)  # display_name, NOT node_title
```

Also: search `discover_nodes` by **function name**, not variable type. To find the Broadcast Delegate node for a `StateTreeDelegate` variable, search `"Broadcast"` — NOT `"Dispatcher"` or `"StateTreeDelegate"`.

### 👀 Reading the User's Live Graph Selection — `get_selected_nodes()`

`get_nodes_in_graph()` returns **every** node in a graph. To act on just the nodes the user has highlighted in the open Blueprint editor, use `get_selected_nodes()` instead. Returned objects are the same `FBlueprintNodeInfo` shape as `get_nodes_in_graph()` — same `node_id`, `node_title`, `node_type`, `pos_x`, `pos_y`, `pin_names`, and `pins` fields — so you can pass `node.node_id` straight into `get_node_pins()`, `set_node_position()`, `delete_node()`, etc.

**The Blueprint MUST already be open in the editor.** Selection state lives on the Slate panel, not on the asset; closing the editor discards it. Calling `get_selected_nodes()` for a closed asset returns an empty array (and logs a warning).

```python
# Caller knows the asset
selected = unreal.BlueprintService.get_selected_nodes("/Game/BP_Player")

# Caller does NOT know which asset the user is looking at — empty path
# returns the selection from the first open Blueprint editor that has one.
selected = unreal.BlueprintService.get_selected_nodes("")

for n in selected:
    print(f"selected: {n.node_title} ({n.node_type}) @ ({n.pos_x}, {n.pos_y})")
    pins = unreal.BlueprintService.get_node_pins("/Game/BP_Player", "EventGraph", n.node_id)
```

Use this when the user says "this node", "the selected node(s)", "what I have highlighted", or "the one I'm looking at". An empty result means *nothing is selected in any open Blueprint editor* — ask the user to click a node in the graph rather than guessing.

### 💬 Comment Boxes — `add_comment_node()` / `add_comment_around_nodes()`

Comment boxes are the coloured bubbles that visually group nodes (the editor shortcut is `C` after selecting nodes). Two APIs:

- **`add_comment_node(blueprint_path, graph_name, comment_text, pos_x, pos_y, width, height, r, g, b, a)`** — explicit position and size. Use when you already know exactly where you want the box.
- **`add_comment_around_nodes(blueprint_path, graph_name, comment_text, node_ids, padding, r, g, b, a)`** — computes the bounding box of the supplied nodes (plus `padding`, default 40 px) and pads room for the title bar. This is the programmatic equivalent of select-then-press-`C`.

#### ✍️ Write *informative* comment text — this is the whole point

Comment boxes are documentation that lives next to the code. A future reader (human or LLM) should be able to glance at the comment and understand **what this group of nodes accomplishes and why**, without re‑reading every pin. Treat the comment text the same way you'd treat a function header comment.

**Good comments** explain intent and behaviour:

- `"Pick a random patrol point and cache its world location for the Move To task"`
- `"On Damage > 0: play hit reaction, flash material, decrement Health"`
- `"Debounce input — ignore re‑presses within 0.25s of the last fire"`
- `"Early‑out when the owning controller is not locally controlled (server‑auth path)"`

**Bad comments** restate node titles or are filler:

- `"Print String"` ❌ (just the node name)
- `"Logic"` / `"Stuff"` / `"TODO"` ❌ (says nothing)
- `"Branch + Set Variable"` ❌ (mechanical, not intent)
- The user's verbatim request like `"add a comment around the nodes"` ❌ — that's the *task*, not the *meaning*

**Workflow**: before calling `add_comment_around_nodes`, inspect the selected nodes (titles, pin connections, variables they read/write) and synthesise a one‑line description of what the group does. If the user gave you a hint ("this is the patrol picker"), build on it; if they didn't, derive it from the nodes themselves. Use multiple lines (`\n`) when the group has a non‑trivial flow worth narrating.

```python
sel = unreal.BlueprintService.get_selected_nodes("/Game/BP_Player")
ids = [n.node_id for n in sel]

# Derive intent from the selected nodes (event, variables read/written, called
# functions) and write a comment that documents WHY this group exists.
comment = (
    "Pick a random patrol point on EnterState\n"
    "Caches the chosen point's world location into PatrolPointLocation\n"
    "so the subsequent Move To task has a stable target."
)

unreal.BlueprintService.add_comment_around_nodes(
    "/Game/BP_Player", "EventGraph", comment, ids)
```

Both functions return the new comment node's `node_id` (a GUID string), or `""` on failure. Colour parameters are RGBA in 0–1 range; the default is the standard pale yellow. Unknown `node_ids` passed to `add_comment_around_nodes()` are skipped with a warning — if *all* IDs are invalid, the call returns `""`.

Standard editor behaviour applies: any K2 nodes whose bounds fall inside the comment box get picked up and dragged with it (GroupMovement mode).

### ⚠️ Branch Node Pin Names

Use **`then`** and **`else`**, NOT `true`/`false`:

```python
# WRONG
connect_nodes(path, func, branch_id, "true", target_id, "execute")

# CORRECT
connect_nodes(path, func, branch_id, "then", target_id, "execute")
connect_nodes(path, func, branch_id, "else", target_id, "execute")
```

### ⚠️ UE5.7 Uses Doubles for Math

| WRONG | CORRECT |
|-------|---------|
| `Greater_FloatFloat` | `Greater_DoubleDouble` |
| `Add_FloatFloat` | `Add_DoubleDouble` |

### ⚠️ Compile Before Using Variables in Nodes

```python
unreal.BlueprintService.add_variable(path, "Health", "float", "100.0")
unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(path)  # REQUIRED before adding nodes
unreal.BlueprintService.add_get_variable_node(path, func, "Health", x, y)
```

### ⚠️ Node IDs Are GUID Strings, Not Small Integers

Do **not** assume Blueprint nodes have numeric IDs like `0` or `1`.
`get_nodes_in_graph()` returns **GUID strings** in `node.node_id`.

```python
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, graph)
for node in nodes:
    print(node.node_id, node.node_title)
```

For function graphs, find nodes by `node_type` or `node_title`.
For event-style overrides, find nodes by the **display title Unreal shows in the graph**, not by the raw override function name.

### ⚠️ Event-Style Overrides Use `"EventGraph"` — NOT the Function Name

When an override is **event-style** (void/latent functions like `ReceiveTreeStart`, `ReceiveTick`,
`ReceiveLatentEnterState`, `ReceiveStateCompleted`), the event node lives inside `"EventGraph"`.
Do **NOT** use the function name as the graph name — that graph doesn't exist.

```python
# WRONG — returns 0 nodes, creates nothing
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, "ReceiveTreeStart")
node_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(bp_path, "ReceiveTreeStart", ...)

# CORRECT — event-style overrides are in EventGraph
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, "EventGraph")
node_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", ...)
```

Common event-style overrides and their **graph name → node title**:

| Raw Function Name | Graph Name | Node Title in Graph |
|---|---|---|
| `ReceiveTreeStart` | `"EventGraph"` | `Event TreeStart` |
| `ReceiveTick` | `"EventGraph"` | `Event Tick` |
| `ReceiveTreeStop` | `"EventGraph"` | `Event TreeStop` |
| `ReceiveLatentEnterState` | `"EventGraph"` | `Event EnterState` |
| `ReceiveLatentTick` | `"EventGraph"` | `Event Tick` |
| `ReceiveStateCompleted` | `"EventGraph"` | `Event StateCompleted` |

Only **function-style** overrides (non-void, like `GetStaticDescription`) create a separate function graph.

### ⚠️ Do Not Guess Blueprint Function Node Names

Blueprint display titles and internal UFunction names are often **not the same**.

Common examples:

| Display title in graph | Internal callable name may be |
|---|---|
| `Get Actor Location` | `K2_GetActorLocation` |
| `Set Actor Location` | `K2_SetActorLocation` |
| `VInterp To` | `VInterpTo` |

If you do not already know the exact callable name, do **not** guess and do **not** batch multiple node creations into one shot. Use one of these two patterns:

1. `discover_nodes()` + `create_node_by_key()` for deterministic editor-style creation.
2. `add_function_call_node()` only after discovery, or when you already know the exact function name.

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/Tasks/STT_Chase"
graph = "EventGraph"

matches = unreal.BlueprintService.discover_nodes(bp_path, "Get Actor Location")
actor_get_location = next(
    node for node in matches
    if node.spawner_key.startswith("FUNC AActor::") or node.spawner_key.startswith("FUNC Actor::")
)

node_id = unreal.BlueprintService.create_node_by_key(
    bp_path, graph, actor_get_location.spawner_key, 400, 0)
assert node_id, actor_get_location.spawner_key
```

If a node-create call returns an empty ID, stop immediately. Re-read the graph, inspect the error output, and fix the lookup before creating anything else.

### ⚠️ Complex Graphs: Create and Verify One Node at a Time

For fragile graph work such as `STT_*` task Blueprints, timers, delegate workflows, or any graph being built from a screenshot:

1. Create **one** node.
2. Re-read the graph and confirm the returned GUID exists.
3. Read that node's pins.
4. Only then create the next node.
5. After all required nodes exist, connect **one** edge at a time and verify the new connection appears in `get_connections()`.

Do **not** create 4-6 nodes in one tool call when some of them have unresolved function names. That makes cleanup harder and leaves duplicate nodes behind on retry.

### ⚠️ Recovery After a Failed Graph Attempt

If a graph-edit attempt fails partway through:

1. Call `get_nodes_in_graph()` and `get_connections()` to see the true post-failure state.
2. Remove orphaned nodes with `delete_node()`.
3. Remove stale links with `disconnect_pin()`.
4. Retry from a clean baseline.

Do **not** invent helper names like `disconnect_all_pins()`. Use the real APIs that exist.

Examples for StateTree task blueprints:

| Override created | Typical graph title |
|---|---|
| `ReceiveLatentEnterState` | `Event EnterState` |
| `ReceiveLatentTick` | `Event Tick` |
| `ReceiveStateCompleted` | `Event StateCompleted` |

### ⚠️ Delay vs Set Timer by Event

When a user asks for a "timer" or "timed delay" in a Blueprint, **use `Set Timer by Event`**, NOT `Delay`:

| Node | Behavior | Use When |
|------|----------|----------|
| `Delay` | **Latent action** — blocks execution flow on that path | Simple linear sequences where nothing else runs during the wait |
| `Set Timer by Event` | **Non-blocking** — fires a delegate callback after the duration | The Blueprint must keep ticking/running during the wait (e.g. State Tree tasks that rotate while waiting, animation tasks, any gameplay that shouldn't freeze) |

The pattern for `Set Timer by Event` requires a **Custom Event**:

Important: after `add_custom_event_node(...)`, immediately re-read the graph and re-find that callback by the returned `node_id`. Do **not** assume the title will be exactly the event name you passed in. Unreal can display custom event titles as multi-line labels such as `OnTimerFinished` + `Custom Event`.

Do **not** silently substitute a `Create Event` / `Create Delegate` node plus a separate function graph when the user asked for a `Custom Event` node or when the target graph should visibly contain the callback in `EventGraph`. A `Create Event` delegate can compile and still be the wrong implementation for the requested graph shape.

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/MyBlueprint"
graph = "EventGraph"

# 1. Add Set Timer by Event node
timer_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(
    bp_path, graph, "KismetSystemLibrary", "K2_SetTimerDelegate", 300, 0)

# 2. Set the Time pin
unreal.BlueprintService.set_node_pin_value(bp_path, graph, timer_id, "Time", "1.0")

# 3. Add a Custom Event node — this is the callback
custom_event_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_custom_event_node(
    bp_path, graph, "OnTimerFinished", 300, 300)

# 4. Connect the Custom Event's delegate output to the timer's Delegate pin
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(
    bp_path, graph, custom_event_id, "OutputDelegate",
    timer_id, "Delegate")

# 5. Wire: EnterState → Set Timer by Event
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(
    bp_path, graph, enter_state_id, "then", timer_id, "execute")

# 6. Wire: Custom Event → Finish Task (or whatever follows)
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(
    bp_path, graph, custom_event_id, "then", finish_id, "execute")
```

### ⚠️ StateTree Task Timer Workflow: Always Discover Real Titles and Pins First

For `STT_*` Blueprint tasks, do **not** guess event titles or pin names. The stable pattern is:

1. `override_function(bp, "ReceiveLatentEnterState")`
2. `get_nodes_in_graph(bp, "EventGraph")` and locate the event by title `Event EnterState`
3. After `add_custom_event_node(...)`, call `get_nodes_in_graph()` again and re-find the callback by the returned GUID
4. Treat the callback title as display-only evidence; custom event titles can be multi-line and should not be your primary lookup key
5. `get_node_pins()` on every newly created node
6. Wire using the **actual pin names returned by the graph**

Current UE 5.7 / VibeUE graph details for this workflow:

| Node | Pin to use |
|---|---|
| `Event EnterState` | `then` |
| `Custom Event` | `OutputDelegate`, `then` |
| `Set Timer by Event` | `execute`, `Delegate`, `Time`, `bLooping`, `bMaxOncePerFrame` |
| `Finish Task` | `execute`, `bSucceeded` |

Success for this workflow also requires the callback node in `EventGraph` to be a real custom event node, typically `K2Node_CustomEvent` in a fresh node listing. `K2Node_CreateDelegate` is a different node type and should not be treated as equivalent when the requested outcome is a visible custom event callback in the graph.

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/STT_Rotate"
graph = "EventGraph"

unreal.BlueprintService.override_function(bp_path, "ReceiveLatentEnterState")

timer_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(
    bp_path, graph, "KismetSystemLibrary", "K2_SetTimerDelegate", 520, 0)
custom_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_custom_event_node(
    bp_path, graph, "OnTimerFinished", 0, 420)
finish_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(
    bp_path, graph, "StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase", "FinishTask", 520, 420)

nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, graph)
enter_node = next((n for n in nodes if n.node_title == "Event EnterState"), None)
custom_node = next((n for n in nodes if n.node_id == custom_id), None)
assert enter_node, "Event EnterState not found"
assert custom_node, f"Custom event {custom_id} not found after create"

custom_pins = unreal.BlueprintService.get_node_pins(bp_path, graph, custom_node.node_id)
print("CUSTOM EVENT TITLE:", custom_node.node_title)
print("CUSTOM EVENT PINS:", [p.pin_name for p in custom_pins])

unreal.BlueprintService.set_node_pin_value(bp_path, graph, timer_id, "Time", "1.0")
unreal.BlueprintService.set_node_pin_value(bp_path, graph, timer_id, "bLooping", "false")
unreal.BlueprintService.set_node_pin_value(bp_path, graph, finish_id, "bSucceeded", "true")

assert unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, enter_node.node_id, "then", timer_id, "execute")
assert unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, custom_node.node_id, "OutputDelegate", timer_id, "Delegate")
assert unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, custom_node.node_id, "then", finish_id, "execute")
```

Use `add_create_event_node()` only when you need a **Create Event / Create Delegate** node. For `Set Timer by Event`, a `Custom Event` node is the simpler callback source and matches the Blueprint editor workflow shown in screenshots.

If a previous attempt already inserted a `Create Event` node for this timer callback, treat that as the wrong graph shape when the request is for a custom event. Remove the wrong node, remove any stale callback function graph that only existed to support that delegate node, then create the real `Custom Event` node and verify it by node ID and node type.

### ⚠️ Verification Is Mandatory Before Claiming Success

After any graph edit, verify all three layers:

1. **Connections**: call `get_connections()` and confirm the exact expected wiring.
2. **Pins**: if a connection fails, call `get_node_pins()` and use the real pin names.
3. **Compile**: inspect `compile_blueprint(...).success`, `num_errors`, and `errors`.

For any node you claim you created, also re-read the graph with `get_nodes_in_graph()` and confirm that node actually exists in the graph after the edit. A returned node ID from a create call is not enough.

For `Custom Event` timer callbacks, verify both of these before wiring:

1. The returned GUID appears in a fresh `get_nodes_in_graph()` result.
2. `get_node_pins()` on that exact node shows the pins you intend to use, typically `OutputDelegate` and `then` for the callback path.

Also verify that the node type is the expected custom event form rather than `K2Node_CreateDelegate`.

```python
result = unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
assert result.success, result.errors

nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, graph)
for node in nodes:
    print(f"NODE {node.node_id} {node.node_title}")

connections = unreal.BlueprintService.get_connections(bp_path, graph)
for conn in connections:
    print(f"{conn.source_node_title}.{conn.source_pin_name} -> {conn.target_node_title}.{conn.target_pin_name}")

unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)
```

Never print `MODIFIED` or describe the graph as complete until the expected connections are present and compile succeeds.
Never describe a node as present until it appears in a fresh `get_nodes_in_graph()` result.
Never treat compile success alone as proof that the graph matches the requested design.

### Required Success Gate For Graph Edits

If you edit a graph, your success check must answer all of these from live asset data:

1. Which required node titles are present?
2. Which exact connection lines prove the intended wiring exists?
3. Did compile succeed with zero relevant errors?

If you cannot answer those three questions from tool output, the task is not complete yet.

For complex graph tasks, also answer these two questions before claiming completion:

4. Which node IDs were created successfully, one by one?
5. What cleanup was done after any failed intermediate attempt?

**Common mistake**: Using `Delay` when the user says "timer". `Delay` is a latent action that
pauses the execution chain. `Set Timer by Event` is non-blocking and fires a separate event —
this is critical for State Tree tasks, animation blueprints, and any actor that must keep
ticking during the wait period.

### Accessing Members of Another Blueprint (`add_member_get_node`)

Use `add_member_get_node` to read a property or component that belongs to another class
(not the current Blueprint). This creates a getter node with a **Target** input pin.

```
Target (input) — the object reference (e.g. your BP_Cube variable output)
MemberName (output) — the property value (e.g. the CubeMesh component)
```

```python
# Get the CubeMesh component from a "Cube" variable of type BP_Cube
mesh_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_member_get_node(
    bp_path, graph, "BP_Cube_C", "CubeMesh", 400, 0)

# Connect: Cube (from validated get) -> Target of the member getter
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, val_get_id, "Cube", mesh_id, "self")
# Output pin name matches the member name: "CubeMesh"
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, mesh_id, "CubeMesh", next_id, "Target")
```

The `TargetClass` must be the generated class name (`BP_Cube_C`, not `BP_Cube`). The function
resolves it via the same 3-step fallback as `create_blueprint`.

### Validated Get Nodes (`add_validated_get_node`)

Use `add_validated_get_node` to create a **Validated Get** — a variable getter with execution
pins that only continues on the valid path if the object reference is non-null.

Pin names produced:

| Pin | Name | Direction |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Execution in | `"execute"` | input |
| Is Valid (object non-null) | `"then"` | output exec |
| Is Not Valid (object null) | `"else"` | output exec |
| Variable data | variable name e.g. `"MyObject"` | output data |

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/BP_MyActor"
graph = "EventGraph"

# Compile first so the variable type is resolved
unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)

# Add BeginPlay + validated get + some function call
begin_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, graph, "ReceiveBeginPlay", 0, 0)
val_get_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_validated_get_node(bp_path, graph, "MyObject", 300, 0)
call_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(bp_path, graph, "MyObject", "SomeFunction", 700, 0)

# Execution flow: BeginPlay -> ValidatedGet (Is Valid path) -> SomeFunction
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, begin_id, "then", val_get_id, "execute")
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, val_get_id, "then", call_id, "execute")

# Data flow: MyObject output -> function Target
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, graph, val_get_id, "MyObject", call_id, "self")

unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)
```

> Only Object/Actor reference variables support Validated Get (`ValidatedObject` variation).
> Primitive types (int, float, bool) produce a Branch-style impure get instead.

---

## Workflows

### Override a Parent Function (BlueprintImplementableEvent / BlueprintNativeEvent)

Use `list_overridable_functions` to discover what can be overridden, then `override_function`
to create the graph. After that, use `get_nodes_in_graph` + `set_node_pin_value` to wire in
return values.

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/STT_Rotate"

# Step 1: See all overridable functions and which are already overridden
funcs = unreal.BlueprintService.list_overridable_functions(bp_path)
for f in funcs:
    status = "OVERRIDDEN" if f.already_overridden else "available"
    print(f"{f.function_name} ({f.owner_class}) [{status}] -> {f.return_type}")
# ⚠️ UE Python strips `b` prefix: use `already_overridden` and `is_native_event` (not `b_already_overridden`)

# Step 2: Create the override graph (idempotent — safe to call even if already exists)
unreal.BlueprintService.override_function(bp_path, "GetStaticDescription")

# Step 3: Inspect the new graph — find the result node
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, "GetStaticDescription")
result_node = next((n for n in nodes if "Result" in n.node_type), None)

# Step 4: Set the return value pin directly (for FText/FString returns use the pin name)
if result_node:
    unreal.BlueprintService.set_node_pin_value(bp_path, "GetStaticDescription", result_node.node_id, "ReturnValue", "Rotate Cube")

# Step 5: Compile and save
unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)
```

#### ⚠️ Event-style vs Function-style overrides

`override_function` automatically picks the right approach based on `is_event_style`:

| `is_event_style` | Mechanism | Where to find the node after |
|---|---|---|
| `True` (void/latent: EnterState, Tick, StateCompleted…) | Event node added to **EventGraph** | `get_nodes_in_graph(bp, "EventGraph")` |
| `False` (returns a value: GetDescription…) | **Function graph** with entry + result | `get_nodes_in_graph(bp, function_name)` |

Never call `add_event_node` manually for override functions — `override_function` handles it.

For event-style overrides, the visible node title is usually the friendly event name Unreal shows in the graph, such as `Event EnterState`, not the raw function name like `ReceiveLatentEnterState`.

#### ⚠️ `list_overridable_functions` vs `list_functions`

| Method | What it returns |
|--------|----------------|
| `list_functions` | Functions **defined in this blueprint** (user-created + already overridden) |
| `list_overridable_functions` | Functions from **parent class** that are override-able, with `already_overridden` and `is_event_style` flags |

Always call `list_overridable_functions` when the user asks "what functions can I override?" or
"override the X function". Never guess function names — they are case-sensitive.

### Create Function with Logic

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/BP_Player"

# Create function with parameters
unreal.BlueprintService.create_function(bp_path, "TakeDamage", is_pure=False)
unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_input(bp_path, "TakeDamage", "Amount", "float", "0.0")
unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_output(bp_path, "TakeDamage", "NewHealth", "float")
unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)

# Add nodes (entry=0, result=1)
get_health = unreal.BlueprintService.add_get_variable_node(bp_path, "TakeDamage", "Health", -400, -100)
subtract = unreal.BlueprintService.add_math_node(bp_path, "TakeDamage", "Subtract", "Float", -200, 0)
set_health = unreal.BlueprintService.add_set_variable_node(bp_path, "TakeDamage", "Health", 200, 0)

# Connect nodes
unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, "TakeDamage", 0, "then", set_health, "execute")
unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)
```

### Add Enhanced Input Action Node

Use `add_input_action_node()` to create an Enhanced Input Action event node in a Blueprint:

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/BP_ThirdPersonCharacter"
ia_path = "/Game/Input/IA_Ragdoll"

# Create the Enhanced Input Action node
node_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_input_action_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", ia_path, -800, 2500)

if node_id:
    # Connect to other nodes - Output pins are: Started, Ongoing, Triggered, Completed, Canceled
    set_physics = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "PrimitiveComponent", "SetSimulatePhysics", -400, 2500)
    unreal.BlueprintService.connect_nodes(bp_path, "EventGraph", node_id, "Started", set_physics, "execute")
    
    unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
    unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)
```

**Important**: The Input Action asset must exist first. Create it with `InputService.create_action()` if needed.

## Node Layout Best Practices

### Layout Constants

```python
GRID_H = 200   # Horizontal spacing
GRID_V = 150   # Vertical spacing
DATA_ROW = -150  # Data getters above execution
EXEC_ROW = 0     # Main execution row
```

### Execution Flow (Left to Right)

```python
# Entry (0,0) → Branch (200,0) → SetVar (400,0) → Return (800,0)
```

### Data Flow (Above Execution)

```python
# Getters at Y=-150, math at Y=-75, execution at Y=0
get_health = add_get_variable_node(bp_path, func, "Health", 200, -150)
subtract = add_math_node(bp_path, func, "Subtract", "Float", 200, -75)
branch = add_branch_node(bp_path, func, 200, 0)
```

### Branch Layout (True/False Paths)

```python
# True path: Y=0 (same row)
# False path: Y=150 (offset down)
set_armor = add_set_variable_node(bp_path, func, "Armor", 400, 0)    # True
set_health = add_set_variable_node(bp_path, func, "Health", 400, 150)  # False
```

### Reposition Entry/Result (CRITICAL)

Entry and Result nodes are stacked at (0,0) by default:

```python
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, func_name)
for node in nodes:
    if "FunctionEntry" in node.node_type:
        unreal.BlueprintService.set_node_position(bp_path, func_name, node.node_id, 0, 0)
    elif "FunctionResult" in node.node_type:
        unreal.BlueprintService.set_node_position(bp_path, func_name, node.node_id, 800, 0)
```

---

## Common Function Call Classes

For `add_function_call_node(path, graph, class, func, x, y)`:

- **KismetMathLibrary** — Math (Add_DoubleDouble, Multiply_DoubleDouble, Sin, Sqrt)
- **KismetSystemLibrary** — System (PrintString, Delay, K2_SetTimerDelegate)
- **KismetStringLibrary** — String (Concat_StrStr, MakeLiteralString, Contains)
- **KismetArrayLibrary** — Array operations (Array_Length, Array_Random, Array_Add, Array_Remove, Array_Clear)
- **GameplayStatics** — Game (GetPlayerController, SpawnActor)
- **Actor** — Actor functions, but discover the exact callable/spawner first for graph nodes like `Get Actor Location` and `Set Actor Location`
- **PrimitiveComponent** — Physics (SetSimulatePhysics)
- **SceneComponent** — Transform (AddRelativeRotation, SetRelativeLocation)

---

## Array Operations

Array operations use **wildcard pins** — the `TargetArray` and element pins start with no type until a typed array is connected. The engine automatically propagates the array element type through all wildcard pins when you connect a typed array variable.

### ⚠️ Random Element From Array — Use `Array_Random`, NOT Manual Length+Random+Get

When you need a random element from an array, use `Array_Random` — a single node that returns
a random item. Do **NOT** manually build `Array_Length` → `RandomIntegerInRange` → `Array_Get`.
That pattern has 3 nodes, is harder to wire, and `Array_Get` is deprecated in UE5.

```python
# CORRECT — single node, editor shows it as "Random Array Item"
arr_rand_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_function_call_node(
    bp_path, "EventGraph", "KismetArrayLibrary", "Array_Random", 600, 200)
# Pins: TargetArray (in, wildcard), OutItem (out, wildcard), OutIndex (out, int)

# Or via build_graph:
{"ref": "rand", "type": "spawner_key", "params": {"key": "FUNC KismetArrayLibrary::Array_Random"}}
```

### Available Array Functions (KismetArrayLibrary)

| Function | Purpose | Key Pins |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `Array_Length` | Get array element count | TargetArray(in), ReturnValue(int) |
| `Array_LastIndex` | Get last valid index | TargetArray(in), ReturnValue(int) |
| `Array_IsEmpty` | Check if empty | TargetArray(in), ReturnValue(bool) |
| **`Array_Random`** | **Get random element ("Random Array Item")** | **TargetArray(in), OutItem(out), OutIndex(int)** |
| `Array_Add` | Add element, returns index | TargetArray(in/out), NewItem(in), ReturnValue(int) |
| `Array_Remove` | Remove by index | TargetArray(in/out), IndexToRemove(int) |
| `Array_Clear` | Remove all elements | TargetArray(in/out) |
| `Array_Contains` | Check if item exists | TargetArray(in), ItemToFind(in), ReturnValue(bool) |
| `Array_Append` | Append another array | TargetArray(in/out), SourceArray(in) |

### ⚠️ Array Get — Use `discover_nodes` First

`Array_Get` is marked **BlueprintInternalUseOnly** and is replaced by the dedicated `K2Node_GetArrayItem` node in modern UE5. Do NOT try to call `Array_Get` directly.

To get an element from an array by index:

```python
# 1. Discover the correct node key
result = unreal.BlueprintService.discover_nodes(bp_path, "MyFunction", "get array")
# Look for: "Get" with key "NODE K2Node_GetArrayItem"

# 2. Create the node
node_id = unreal.BlueprintService.create_node_by_key(bp_path, "MyFunction", "NODE K2Node_GetArrayItem", 400, 200)
```

### Wildcard Pin Type Propagation

When you connect a typed array to an array function's `TargetArray` pin, the engine automatically resolves
all wildcard pins on that node to the correct element type. This is handled by `UK2Node_CallArrayFunction`.

**Pattern for array operations in `build_graph`:**

```python
result = unreal.BlueprintService.build_graph(bp_path, graph_name,
    nodes=[
        # Get the array variable
        {"ref": "get_arr", "type": "variable_get", "params": {"variable": "MyTargetPoints"}},
        # Get array length
        {"ref": "arr_len", "type": "spawner_key", "params": {"key": "FUNC KismetArrayLibrary::Array_Length"}},
        # Get random element
        {"ref": "arr_rand", "type": "spawner_key", "params": {"key": "FUNC KismetArrayLibrary::Array_Random"}},
    ],
    connections=[
        # Connect typed array to wildcard pins — type propagation happens automatically
        ["get_arr.MyTargetPoints", "arr_len.TargetArray"],
        ["get_arr.MyTargetPoints", "arr_rand.TargetArray"],
    ],
    auto_layout=True
)
```

### Common Mistakes with Arrays

1. **Using Array_Get directly** → Deprecated, use `NODE K2Node_GetArrayItem` instead
2. **Not connecting the typed array source first** → Wildcard pins stay unresolved → compile error: "The type of Target Array is undetermined"
3. **Guessing pin names** → Always use `get_node_pins()` to verify pin names after node creation

## Batch Graph Builder (`build_graph`)

### When to Use

Use `build_graph` when you need to create **3+ nodes with connections** in a single call. It is
significantly faster and less error-prone than creating nodes one-at-a-time for complex graphs.

Use the individual `add_*_node` + `connect_nodes` methods when:
- You need to create 1-2 nodes
- You need to inspect pins between node creations
- The exact function name is uncertain (use `discover_nodes` first)

### Node Types

| Type | Required Params | Description |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| `function_call` | `class`, `function` | Calls a UFunction (e.g. `KismetSystemLibrary::PrintString`) |
| `spawner_key` | `key` | Creates node from a spawner key (FUNC, EVENT, NODE prefix) |
| `variable_get` | `variable` | Gets a Blueprint variable |
| `variable_set` | `variable` | Sets a Blueprint variable |
| `event` | `event` | Overridable event (e.g. `ReceiveBeginPlay`) |
| `custom_event` | `name` | Custom event node |
| `branch` | *(none)* | If/Then/Else branch |
| `cast` | `target_class` | Dynamic cast |
| `print_string` | *(none)* | PrintString shorthand |
| `input_action` | `action` | Enhanced Input Action (asset path) |
| `math` | `operation`, `operand_type` | Math op (Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide/Clamp/Abs) |
| `comparison` | `operation`, `operand_type` | Comparison (Greater/Less/Equal/NotEqual/GreaterEqual/LessEqual) |
| `delegate_bind` | `delegate`, (optional: `component`) | Bind a multicast delegate |
| `create_event` | `function` | Create Event node |
| `validated_get` | `variable` | Validated Get (with exec pins) |
| `member_get` | `member`, `class` | Get member from another class |
| `create_delegate` | `function` | Create Delegate node |
| `make_struct` | `struct` | Make Struct node (`K2Node_MakeStruct`) for any struct type (engine or user-defined) |
| `instanced_struct` | `struct` | Make Instanced Struct node — wraps a struct into `FInstancedStruct` |

### Connection Format

Connections use `"RefOrGUID.PinName"` format: `{"from_": "A.then", "to": "B.execute"}`

**⚠️ Key name is `from_` (with underscore)** because `from` is a Python reserved keyword.
UE Python maps the C++ UPROPERTY `From` to `from_`.

The ref part can be either:
- A **local ref** from the `Nodes` array (e.g. `"MkInst"`)
- An **existing node GUID** already in the graph (32-char hex string from `get_nodes_in_graph()`)

This allows `build_graph` to wire new nodes to existing nodes in a single call:

```python
# Mix local refs with existing GUIDs
existing_id = "EB9221E84DFFF609028F9DAA6267B654"  # from get_nodes_in_graph()
connections = [
    {"from_": f"{existing_id}.OutputPin", "to": "NewNode.InputPin"},  # existing → new
    {"from_": "NewNode.OutputPin", "to": "OtherNew.InputPin"},        # new → new
]
```

Pin aliases supported:
- `execute` / `exec` → first exec input pin
- `then` / `output` → first exec output pin
- `value` / `result` → first non-exec output pin
- `True` → `then`, `False` → `else` (Branch node)

### Example: BeginPlay → PrintString

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/BP_MyActor"

result = unreal.BlueprintService.build_graph(
    bp_path,
    "EventGraph",
    # Nodes
    [
        {"ref": "BP", "type": "event", "params": {"event": "ReceiveBeginPlay"}},
        {"ref": "Print", "type": "print_string", "params": {}},
    ],
    # Connections
    [
        {"from_": "BP.then", "to": "Print.execute"},
    ],
    # Pin defaults
    [
        {"node_ref": "Print", "pin_name": "InString", "value": "Hello World!"},
    ],
    True,  # auto-layout
    True   # compile after
)

print(f"Success: {result.b_success}")
print(f"Nodes: {result.nodes_created}/{result.nodes_created + result.nodes_failed}")
print(f"Connections: {result.connections_made}/{result.connections_made + result.connections_failed}")
if result.errors:
    for e in result.errors:
        print(f"  ERROR: {e}")
```

### Example: Branch with Math

```python
result = unreal.BlueprintService.build_graph(
    bp_path,
    "EventGraph",
    [
        {"ref": "BP", "type": "event", "params": {"event": "ReceiveBeginPlay"}},
        {"ref": "GetHP", "type": "variable_get", "params": {"variable": "Health"}},
        {"ref": "Cmp", "type": "comparison", "params": {"operation": "Less", "operand_type": "Double"}},
        {"ref": "Branch", "type": "branch", "params": {}},
        {"ref": "PrintLow", "type": "print_string", "params": {}},
        {"ref": "PrintOK", "type": "print_string", "params": {}},
    ],
    [
        {"from_": "BP.then", "to": "Branch.execute"},
        {"from_": "GetHP.Health", "to": "Cmp.A"},
        {"from_": "Cmp.ReturnValue", "to": "Branch.Condition"},
        {"from_": "Branch.then", "to": "PrintLow.execute"},
        {"from_": "Branch.else", "to": "PrintOK.execute"},
    ],
    [
        {"node_ref": "Cmp", "pin_name": "B", "value": "25.0"},
        {"node_ref": "PrintLow", "pin_name": "InString", "value": "Health is low!"},
        {"node_ref": "PrintOK", "pin_name": "InString", "value": "Health OK"},
    ],
    True, True
)
```

### StateTreeDelegate Broadcast — Replace Finish Task with Broadcast Delegate

When a StateTree task Blueprint has a `StateTreeDelegate` variable (e.g. `FinishRotatingDispatcher`) and the user wants the custom event timer callback to **broadcast** that delegate instead of calling `Finish Task`, the graph must:

1. Disconnect `CustomEvent.then → Finish Task.execute`
2. Delete the `Finish Task` node
3. Discover the `Broadcast Delegate` spawner key (search `"Broadcast"`)
4. Create a `Broadcast Delegate` node + a variable GET for the delegate
5. Connect `CustomEvent.then → Broadcast.execute` and `GET.FinishRotatingDispatcher → Broadcast.Dispatcher`

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/Tasks/STT_Rotate"
graph = "EventGraph"

# Step 1: Find node GUIDs
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, graph)
custom_node = next((n for n in nodes if "CustomEvent" in n.node_type or "Custom Event" in n.node_title), None)
finish_node = next((n for n in nodes if "Finish Task" in n.node_title), None)
assert custom_node and finish_node, "Nodes not found"

# Step 2: Disconnect CustomEvent.then (correct: 4 args)
unreal.BlueprintService.disconnect_pin(bp_path, graph, custom_node.node_id, "then")

# Step 3: Delete Finish Task
unreal.BlueprintService.delete_node(bp_path, graph, finish_node.node_id)

# Step 4: Discover Broadcast Delegate node — search "Broadcast" NOT "Dispatcher"
matches = unreal.BlueprintService.discover_nodes(bp_path, "Broadcast", "", 10)
for m in matches:
    print(m.display_name, m.spawner_key)  # display_name, NOT node_title

broadcast_node = next((m for m in matches if "Broadcast" in m.display_name), None)
assert broadcast_node, "Broadcast Delegate node not found"

# Step 5: Build replacement — Broadcast + GET variable
result = unreal.BlueprintService.build_graph(
    bp_path, graph,
    [
        {"ref": "Broadcast", "type": "spawner_key", "params": {"key": broadcast_node.spawner_key}},
        {"ref": "GetDisp", "type": "variable_get", "params": {"variable": "FinishRotatingDispatcher"}},
    ],
    [
        {"from_": f"{custom_node.node_id}.then", "to": "Broadcast.execute"},
        {"from_": "GetDisp.FinishRotatingDispatcher", "to": "Broadcast.Dispatcher"},
    ],
    [], True, True
)
print(f"Success: {result.b_success}, errors: {result.errors}")
```

**Target (self)** on the Broadcast node connects to `self` by default when the Blueprint is the correct class (`StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase`). You do not need to wire it manually.

### Round-Trip: Export → Modify → Rebuild

Use `get_graph_definition` to capture an existing graph, modify the definition, then
rebuild with `build_graph`:

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/BP_MyActor"
graph = "EventGraph"

# Export current graph
nodes, connections, defaults, error = unreal.BlueprintService.get_graph_definition(
    bp_path, graph)

# Inspect exported nodes
for n in nodes:
    print(f"  {n.ref}: {n.type} {n.params}")

# Modify (add a new node, change a connection, etc.)
# Then rebuild in a different graph or blueprint
```

### Auto-Layout (`auto_layout_graph` / `auto_layout_selected_nodes`)

Both methods use the same simplified Sugiyama algorithm:
- Layers assigned by BFS on execution (exec pin) flow; falls back to data-flow BFS if exec flow is flat
- Pure data nodes placed one column left of their first exec consumer
- Independent event chains get separate vertical bands so they never overlap
- Event/entry nodes sort to the top of each layer
- Column width: 450 px, Row height: 180 px

**`auto_layout_graph`** — repositions **every** node in the graph:

```python
unreal.BlueprintService.auto_layout_graph(bp_path, "EventGraph")
```

**`auto_layout_selected_nodes`** — repositions **only the listed nodes**; everything else is untouched.
Adjacency (exec + data edges) is computed within the selection only, so the layout is self-contained.
The origin is anchored to the top-left corner of the selection's current bounding box.

```python
# Layout whatever is currently selected in the Blueprint Editor
selected = unreal.BlueprintService.get_selected_nodes(bp_path)
ids = [n.node_id for n in selected]
unreal.BlueprintService.auto_layout_selected_nodes(bp_path, "EventGraph", ids)

# Layout a hand-picked subset by GUID
unreal.BlueprintService.auto_layout_selected_nodes(
    bp_path, "EventGraph",
    ["GUID-A", "GUID-B", "GUID-C"])
```

### Make Struct and Make Instanced Struct

Use `make_struct` to create a `K2Node_MakeStruct` for any struct type (engine or user-defined).
Use `instanced_struct` to wrap a struct into `FInstancedStruct` — required when a pin expects `FInstancedStruct` (e.g. `Make State Tree Event.Payload`).

**⚠️ The `Value` pin on `Make Instanced Struct` is a wildcard.** It resolves to the struct's fields only after the struct type is set via `struct` param. Do **not** try to split or connect it before the node type is resolved — connecting by field name (e.g. `Value.TargetPawn`) will fail.

**Correct pattern — build_graph example:**

```python
result = unreal.BlueprintService.build_graph(
    bp_path,
    "EventGraph",
    [
        # 1. Make the struct with its fields populated
        {"ref": "MkPayload", "type": "make_struct", "params": {"struct": "FStartChasingPayload"}},
        # 2. Wrap it in FInstancedStruct
        {"ref": "MkInst", "type": "instanced_struct", "params": {"struct": "FStartChasingPayload"}},
    ],
    [
        # Wire the struct output into the instanced struct Value pin
        {"from_": "MkPayload.StartChasingPayload", "to": "MkInst.Value"},
        # Wire MkInst output into whatever consumes FInstancedStruct
        {"from_": "MkInst.ReturnValue", "to": "MkState.Payload"},
    ],
    [],
    True, True
)
```

**Pin names for `make_struct`:** The output pin name matches the struct type name exactly as Unreal exposes it (e.g. `StartChasingPayload` for `FStartChasingPayload`). If uncertain, create the node, then call `get_node_pins()` to read the actual output pin name before connecting.

**Pin names for `instanced_struct`:** Input is `Value`, output is `ReturnValue`.

### Error Handling

`build_graph` returns `FBuildGraphResult` with detailed audit:
- `b_success` — `True` only if zero node failures AND zero compile errors
- `nodes_created` / `nodes_failed` — individual node creation results
- `connections_made` / `connections_failed` — wiring results
- `defaults_set` / `defaults_failed` — pin default results
- `ref_to_node_id` — maps your local refs to engine GUIDs
- `errors` — critical failures (node not found, class not found, compile errors)
- `warnings` — non-fatal issues (pin mismatch, connection rejected)

Always check `result.errors` and `result.warnings` after a `build_graph` call.
