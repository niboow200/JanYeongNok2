# StateTree Skill

StateTree is Unreal Engine's hierarchical state machine system for AI behavior and game logic.
This skill covers creating and editing StateTree assets via `unreal.StateTreeService`.

## ⚠️ StateTree Blueprint Tasks Require the Blueprints Skill

**StateTree Tasks prefixed `STT_` (e.g. `STT_Rotate`, `STT_Move`) are Blueprint assets.**
They are edited with `BlueprintService`, not `StateTreeService`.

**Always load the `blueprints` skill** when the user asks to:
- Add or edit variables on an STT task
- Override functions (`GetDescription`, `ReceiveLatentTick`, `ReceiveLatentEnterState`, etc.)
- Add Blueprint nodes or connect pins inside an STT task graph
- Inspect or modify STT task logic

**Also load the `blueprint-graphs` skill** when the task involves node wiring, timers, custom events,
pin names, or EventGraph layout inside an `STT_*` Blueprint.

```
StateTreeService  → edits the StateTree ASSET (states, tasks list, transitions, parameters)
BlueprintService  → edits the STT Blueprint CONTENT (variables, function graphs, node wiring)
```

Use `manage_skills(action='load', skill_name='blueprints')` before writing any code that
touches an `STT_*` Blueprint's internals.

If the request mentions timers, delayed completion, event callbacks, or screenshots of Blueprint graphs,
also load:

```python
manage_skills(action='load', skill_name='blueprint-graphs')
```

## ⚠️ STT Graph Editing Rules

When editing `STT_*` Blueprint task graphs:

1. Use `override_function()` for StateTree task events like `ReceiveLatentEnterState`.
2. Find the created event node by its **graph title** such as `Event EnterState`, not by the raw function name.
3. For node wiring, timer callbacks, and custom events, follow the detailed workflow in the `blueprint-graphs` skill.
4. For non-blocking waits, prefer `Set Timer by Event`, not `Delay`.
5. If the requested callback is a custom event, the callback must exist as a real `Custom Event` node in `EventGraph`, not as a `Create Event` delegate node plus a separate function graph.
6. Use `FinishTask` with pin name `bSucceeded`.
7. After wiring, always inspect `get_nodes_in_graph()`, `get_connections()`, and `compile_blueprint(...).success` before claiming success.
8. For complex graphs, create and verify one node at a time before creating the next node.
9. If any node-create step fails, stop, audit the graph, clean up orphaned nodes with `delete_node()` / `disconnect_pin()`, and only then retry.

### STT Strict Graph Build Mode

For `STT_*` task graphs built from screenshots or multi-node requests, use this execution order:

1. Create one node.
2. Confirm its GUID exists in a fresh `get_nodes_in_graph()` result.
3. Inspect its pins with `get_node_pins()`.
4. Only then create the next node.
5. After all nodes are proven present, connect one wire at a time and verify each new edge appears in `get_connections()`.

Do not batch unresolved function-call nodes into a single tool call. If the graph depends on nodes such as `Get Actor Location`, `Set Actor Location`, or `VInterp To`, discover the exact node first through the Blueprint graph workflow instead of guessing the underlying function name.

### STT Completion Contract

For `STT_*` graph edits, do not report success until the output explicitly shows:

1. `Event EnterState` exists.
2. `Set Timer by Event` exists.
3. The callback event node exists in a fresh node listing and is the requested node type.
4. The expected execution and delegate connections exist.
5. `Finish Task.bSucceeded` is set correctly.
6. Compile succeeds.

If compile succeeds but any of the checks above fail, the graph is still wrong.
If compile succeeds but some required node IDs were empty during creation, the graph is still wrong.

## Sending a StateTree Event with a Struct Payload from Blueprint

When an actor Blueprint needs to send a StateTree event that carries data (e.g. a target pawn,
position, or any custom struct), use this three-node chain:

```
Make <FMyStruct>  →  Make Instanced Struct  →  Make State Tree Event  →  Send State Tree Event
```

**Always load `blueprint-graphs`** before writing this code — the node types (`make_struct`,
`instanced_struct`) are documented there.

### Why Instanced Struct?

`Make State Tree Event.Payload` expects `FInstancedStruct`, not a raw struct. `Make Instanced Struct`
wraps any struct into `FInstancedStruct`. The struct type must be set at node creation time so the
`Value` wildcard pin resolves correctly — **do not try to connect `Value` before the struct type
is configured**.

### Pattern (using `build_graph`)

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/BP_Cube.BP_Cube"
graph = "EventGraph"

# Read existing node IDs first (Set TargetPawn, Get StateTree, Make State Tree Event, etc.)
nodes = unreal.BlueprintService.get_nodes_in_graph(bp_path, graph)
set_pawn_id    = next(n.node_id for n in nodes if n.node_title == "Set TargetPawn" and ...)
make_event_id  = next(n.node_id for n in nodes if n.node_title == "Make State Tree Event")
send_event_id  = next(n.node_id for n in nodes if "Send State Tree Event" in n.node_title)

result = unreal.BlueprintService.build_graph(
    bp_path, graph,
    [
        {"ref": "MkPayload", "type": "make_struct",     "params": {"struct": "FMyPayload"}},
        {"ref": "MkInst",    "type": "instanced_struct","params": {"struct": "FMyPayload"}},
    ],
    [
        # Rewire execution: SetPawn.then → MkPayload → MkInst → SendEvent
        # (disconnect old SetPawn.then → SendEvent first if needed)
        {"from_": "MkPayload.MyPayload",  "to": "MkInst.Value"},
        {"from_": "MkInst.ReturnValue",   "to": f"{make_event_id}.Payload"},
    ],
    [],
    True, True
)
```

### Pin names to verify

| Node | Key pins |
|------|----------|
| `Make <FMyPayload>` (`make_struct`) | Output: struct type name (check with `get_node_pins()`) |
| `Make Instanced Struct` (`instanced_struct`) | Input: `Value`; Output: `ReturnValue` |
| `Make State Tree Event` | Inputs: `Tag` (FGameplayTag), `Payload` (FInstancedStruct), `Origin` (FName) |
| `Send State Tree Event` | Inputs: `execute`, `self` (StateTreeComponent), `Event` (FStateTreeEvent) |

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- Connecting `Cast.AsPawn → MakeInst.Value.TargetPawn` directly — **fails**. You must go through
  `Make <FMyPayload>` first to populate the struct fields, then feed the struct into `MakeInst.Value`.
- Forgetting to disconnect the old `SetPawn.then → SendEvent.execute` wire before inserting the
  new nodes in between.
- Not passing the `struct` param to `instanced_struct` — the `Value` pin stays a wildcard and
  connections will fail at compile time.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **StateTree Asset** | The `.uasset` file containing the tree definition |
| **Subtree / Root State** | Top-level state (usually named "Root") — created with empty `parent_path` |
| **State** | A node in the tree; can have tasks, enter conditions, transitions, and child states |
| **Task** | Logic that runs while a state is active. Can be a C++ struct (`FStateTreeDelayTask`) or a **Blueprint asset** (`STT_MyTask`) |
| **Blueprint Task** | An `STT_*` Blueprint asset extending `StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase` — edited with `BlueprintService` |
| **Evaluator** | Global computation that runs every tick; provides data to all states |
| **Global Task** | Task that runs as long as the StateTree is active |
| **Transition** | Rule that moves execution from one state to another |
| **Compile** | Converts editor data to runtime format — **required after any structural change** |

## State Paths

States are addressed with `/`-separated paths starting from the subtree name:

```
Root                → top-level subtree
Root/Walking        → child of Root named Walking
Root/Walking/Idle   → child of Walking named Idle
```

## Workflow

```python
import unreal

# 1. Create the asset
unreal.StateTreeService.create_state_tree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")

# 2. Build hierarchy (empty parent_path = new top-level subtree)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "", "Root")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", "Idle")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", "Walking")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", "Attacking")

# 3. Add tasks
unreal.StateTreeService.add_task("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask")

# 4. Add transitions
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(
    "/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Idle",
    "OnStateCompleted", "GotoState", "Root/Walking")

unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(
    "/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Walking",
    "OnStateCompleted", "Succeeded")

# 5. Compile — always required after changes
result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
if not result.success:
    print("Errors:", result.errors)

# 6. Save
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")

# 7. Select the last state you modified so the user can see it
unreal.VibeUEService.manage_asset(action="open", asset_path="/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_expanded("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", True)
unreal.StateTreeService.select_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Walking")  # select whichever state you just edited
```

## API Reference

### Discovery

```python
# List all StateTrees under a directory
paths = unreal.StateTreeService.list_state_trees("/Game")          # → ["/Game/AI/MyBehavior", ...]
paths = unreal.StateTreeService.list_state_trees("/Game/AI")       # → narrowed search

# Get full structural info
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
# info.asset_name, info.schema_class, info.context_actor_class, info.is_compiled
# info.context_actor_class → path of the context actor class (empty if not set!)
# info.evaluators       → list of FStateTreeNodeInfo
# info.global_tasks     → list of FStateTreeNodeInfo
# info.all_states       → list of FStateTreeStateInfo (flattened)

# Each FStateTreeStateInfo has:
#   .name, .path, .state_type, .selection_behavior, .enabled
#   .theme_color (display name of assigned color, empty if none)
#   .tasks, .enter_conditions, .transitions, .child_paths
# NOTE: Do NOT access .expanded — it may not be exposed depending on the
#       compiled plugin version. Use set_state_expanded() directly instead.
```

### Asset Creation

```python
# Create a new StateTree
unreal.StateTreeService.create_state_tree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
```

### State Management

```python
# Add a top-level subtree (equivalent to Root)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "", "Root")

# Add child states
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", "Idle")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", "Idle", "State")  # explicit type

# State types: "State" (default), "Group", "Subtree", "Linked", "LinkedAsset"
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", "BehaviorGroup", "Group")

# Change type of an existing state: "State", "Group", "Subtree"
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_type("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Peaceful", "Subtree")

# Linked type — links to another subtree in the same tree
unreal.StateTreeService.set_linked_subtree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Extension", "Peaceful")

# LinkedAsset type — links to a different StateTree asset
unreal.StateTreeService.set_linked_asset("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Extension", "/Game/AI/OtherBehavior")

# Move a state in-place to a new parent. This preserves the original state object and its data.
unreal.StateTreeService.move_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Idle", "Root/BehaviorGroup")

# Remove a state (also removes children)
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_state("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Walking")

# Enable/disable
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_enabled("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Idle", True)

# Theme colors — list, set, rename (see Theme Colors section below for details)
colors = unreal.StateTreeService.get_theme_colors("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_theme_color("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Idle", "Idle", unreal.LinearColor(r=0.2, g=0.6, b=1.0, a=1.0))
unreal.StateTreeService.rename_theme_color("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Default Color", "Active")

# Expand/collapse states in editor tree view
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_expanded("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Walking", False)  # collapse
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_expanded("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Walking", True)   # expand
```

#### Editor State Selection

Use `select_state` to highlight a state in the StateTree editor panel (equivalent to clicking it).

**Trigger:** If the user asks to "focus", "view", "open", or "select" a state — they all mean the same thing. Use this workflow for all of them.

**Also:** After ANY modification to a state (add task, add transition, set property, etc.), always call `select_state` on the state you just changed so the user can see the result in the editor.

```python
import unreal

# Open the asset first (if not already open)
unreal.VibeUEService.manage_asset(action="open", asset_path="/Game/AI/ST_Cube")

# Expand parents so the state is visible
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_expanded("/Game/AI/ST_Cube", "Root", True)

# Select the state — highlights it in the editor panel
unreal.StateTreeService.select_state("/Game/AI/ST_Cube", "Root/Idle")
```

`select_state` calls `FStateTreeViewModel::SetSelection` via `UStateTreeEditingSubsystem`, which is exactly what the editor does when the user clicks a state node. The asset must already be open in an editor tab.

### Tasks

```python
# Find available task types
types = unreal.StateTreeService.get_available_task_types()

# Add a task to a state
unreal.StateTreeService.add_task("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_task("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root", "FStateTreeRunSubtreeTask")
```

#### ⚠️ Always check before adding — tasks accumulate and don't auto-deduplicate

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"
state_path = "Root/Idle"
task_struct = "FStateTreeDelayTask"

# WRONG — adds a duplicate if task already exists
unreal.StateTreeService.add_task(st_path, state_path, task_struct)

# CORRECT — check first
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(st_path)
for state in info.all_states:
    if state.path == state_path:
        existing = [t.struct_type for t in state.tasks]
        print(f"Existing tasks: {existing}")
        if "StateTreeDelayTask" not in existing:
            unreal.StateTreeService.add_task(st_path, state_path, task_struct)
            print("ADDED task")
        else:
            print("Task already exists, skipping add")
```

#### `StateTreeDebugTextTask` in UE5.7

In UE5.7, `FStateTreeDebugTextTask` exposes editable properties across both the task node struct and the task instance data. Common properties include:
- `Text` (FString)
- `TextColor` (FColor)
- `FontScale` (float)
- `Offset` (FVector) and dotted child paths like `Offset.Z`
- `bEnabled` (bool)
- `BindableText` (FString)
- `ReferenceActor` (TObjectPtr<AActor>)

Always call `get_task_property_names` first and use the exact returned property names. Do not guess aliases like `Color` when the real property name is `TextColor`.

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_task_property_names(st_path, "Root", "FStateTreeDebugTextTask")
for p in props:
    print(f"  {p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")
# Example UE5.7 output:
#   Text: FString = ""
#   TextColor: FColor = (B=255,G=255,R=255,A=255)
#   FontScale: float = 1.000000
#   Offset: FVector = (X=0.000000,Y=0.000000,Z=0.000000)
#   Offset.Z: double = 0.000000
#   bEnabled: bool = True
#   ReferenceActor: TObjectPtr<AActor> = None
#   BindableText: FString = ""

# Set the display text and text color
result = unreal.StateTreeService.set_task_property_value_detailed(
    st_path, "Root", "FStateTreeDebugTextTask", "Text", "Hello from Root")
assert result.success, result.error_message

result = unreal.StateTreeService.set_task_property_value_detailed(
    st_path, "Root", "FStateTreeDebugTextTask", "TextColor", "(R=255,G=105,B=180,A=255)")
assert result.success, result.error_message
result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)
assert result.success
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(st_path)
```

### Setting Task Properties — Deterministic Pattern

Use the service first. Do not guess property names, and do not target duplicate tasks implicitly.

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"
state_path = "Root"

# Step 1: Inspect the exact tasks on the state and count duplicate struct matches.
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(st_path)
matching_tasks = []
for state in info.all_states:
    if state.path == state_path:
        running_index_by_struct = {}
        for task in state.tasks:
            struct_type = task.struct_type
            match_index = running_index_by_struct.get(struct_type, 0)
            running_index_by_struct[struct_type] = match_index + 1
            print(f"Task match {match_index}: {task.name} ({struct_type})")
            if struct_type == "FStateTreeDebugTextTask":
                matching_tasks.append(match_index)

task_match_index = matching_tasks[-1] if matching_tasks else -1
assert task_match_index != -1, "Root has no FStateTreeDebugTextTask"

# Step 2: Discover valid property paths for that exact task match.
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_task_property_names(
    st_path, state_path, "FStateTreeDebugTextTask", task_match_index)
for p in props:
    print(f"  {p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")
# Step 3: Set a property using the detailed result API.
set_result = unreal.StateTreeService.set_task_property_value_detailed(
    st_path, state_path, "FStateTreeDebugTextTask",
    "Text", "Hello from Root", task_match_index)

assert set_result.success, set_result.error_message
print(f"Previous value: {set_result.previous_value!r}")
print(f"New value: {set_result.new_value!r}")

# Step 4: Compile and save.
compile_result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)
assert compile_result.success, compile_result.errors
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(st_path)
print("Done")
```

For nested struct properties, use the exact dotted path returned by `get_task_property_names`
(for example `Offset.Z`) instead of inventing it.

### Evaluators & Global Tasks

**Evaluators** run every tick and feed computed data to all states (read-only output).
**Global Tasks** run for the entire lifetime of the StateTree (full task lifecycle: EnterState, Tick, ExitState).

Both support C++ structs and Blueprint assets.

#### Evaluators

```python
# Find available evaluator types (includes both struct and Blueprint evaluator types)
types = unreal.StateTreeService.get_available_evaluator_types()

# Add global evaluator by struct name (runs every tick, data available to all states)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_evaluator("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "FMyCustomEvaluator")

# Add Blueprint evaluator by name, path, or generated class name (all three work)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_evaluator("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "STE_PatrolPointManagement")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_evaluator("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "/Game/StateTree/Evaluators/STE_PatrolPointManagement")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_evaluator("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "STE_PatrolPointManagement_C")
```

#### Global Tasks

```python
# Find available task types (use this to get the exact registered name for Blueprint tasks)
types = unreal.StateTreeService.get_available_task_types()
for t in types:
    print(t)  # e.g. "STT_PatrolManagement_C"

# Add a C++ struct global task
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "FStateTreeDelayTask")

# Add a Blueprint global task — supports the same name forms as add_evaluator:
# name, full asset path, or _C generated class name
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "STT_PatrolManagement")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "/Game/StateTree/Tasks/STT_PatrolManagement")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task("/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "STT_PatrolManagement_C")
```

#### ⚠️ Always Check Before Adding — Global Tasks Accumulate

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"

# Check existing global tasks before adding
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(st_path)
existing_global = [t.name for t in info.global_tasks]
print(f"Existing global tasks: {existing_global}")

if "STT PatrolManagement" not in existing_global:
    result = unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task(st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement")
    print(f"Added global task: {result}")
else:
    print("Global task already present, skipping")
```

#### Binding Global Task Properties

Global tasks support the same property binding patterns as per-state tasks. Use `bind_global_task_property_to_root_parameter` or `bind_global_task_property_to_context`.

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/StateTree/ST_Cube"

# Inspect what properties the global task exposes
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_global_task_property_names(st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement")
for p in props:
    print(f"  {p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")

# Set a property value directly
unreal.StateTreeService.set_global_task_property_value(st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement", "PatrolTag", "Patrol1")

# Bind a global task property to a root parameter
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_global_task_property_to_root_parameter(
    st_path,
    "STT_PatrolManagement",   # task name (Blueprint name, _C class, or display name)
    "PatrolTag",              # task property to bind
    "PatrolTag"               # root parameter name
)

# Bind a global task property to the context Actor
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_global_task_property_to_context(
    st_path,
    "STT_PatrolManagement",
    "ActorRef",               # task property to bind
    "Actor",                  # context name
    ""                        # context property path (empty = whole object)
)

# Bind a state task property to a property produced by a global task
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_task_property_to_global_task_property(
    st_path,
    "Peaceful/Patrol",        # state path containing the task to update
    "STT_MoveToPatrolPoint",  # state task name
    "PatrolPointManager",     # target property on the state task
    "STT_PatrolManagement",   # source global task name
    "PatrolPointManager"      # source property on the global task
)
```

#### Full Add + Bind Workflow

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/StateTree/ST_Cube"

# 1. Check if already present
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(st_path)
existing = [t.name for t in info.global_tasks]

if "STT PatrolManagement" not in existing:
    ok = unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task(st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement")
    print(f"add_global_task: {ok}")
    assert ok, "add_global_task returned False"

# 2. Inspect properties
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_global_task_property_names(st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement")
for p in props:
    print(f"  {p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")

# 3. Bind to root parameter (if PatrolTag root param exists)
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_global_task_property_to_root_parameter(
    st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement", "PatrolTag", "PatrolTag")

# 4. Compile and save
result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)
assert result.success, result.errors
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(st_path)
print("Done")
```

### Transitions

```python
# Triggers:
#   OnStateCompleted   — after tasks complete (success or failure)
#   OnStateSucceeded   — only on task success
#   OnStateFailed      — only on task failure
#   OnTick             — every tick (use with conditions)
#   OnEvent            — on gameplay event
#   OnDelegate         — when a task's FStateTreeDelegateDispatcher fires
#                        (requires bind_transition_to_delegate after setting trigger)

# Transition types:
#   GotoState          — go to a specific state (requires target_path)
#   Succeeded          — complete this state as succeeded
#   Failed             — complete this state as failed
#   NextState          — go to the next sibling state
#   NextSelectableState — go to the next eligible sibling

# Priorities: Low, Normal (default), Medium, High, Critical

# GotoState example
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(
    "/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Idle",
    "OnStateCompleted", "GotoState", "Root/Walking", "Normal")

# Complete state on failure
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(
    "/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Walking",
    "OnStateFailed", "Failed")

# Loop back to same state
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(
    "/Game/AI/MyBehavior", "Root/Attacking",
    "OnStateSucceeded", "GotoState", "Root/Attacking")
```

### OnDelegate Transitions — Full Workflow

`OnDelegate` transitions fire when a task's `FStateTreeDelegateDispatcher` property broadcasts.
This requires **three steps**: add the dispatcher variable, set the trigger, bind the transition.

#### ⚠️ Expected Compile Error — Do NOT Revert

After calling `update_transition(trigger="OnDelegate")`, compiling will produce:

```
"<StateName> On Delegate Transition to '<TargetState>' requires to be bound to some delegate dispatcher."
```

**This is expected.** The binding step (`bind_transition_to_delegate`) hasn't been done yet.
Do NOT revert the trigger back to `OnStateCompleted` — continue with the workflow below.

#### Step-by-Step

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/Tasks/STT_Rotate"
st_path = "/Game/StateTree/ST_Cube"
state_path = "Root/Rotating"
transition_index = 0  # from get_state_tree_info

# Step 1: Add a FStateTreeDelegateDispatcher variable to the Blueprint task
if not unreal.BlueprintService.variable_exists(bp_path, "FinishRotatingDispatcher"):
    result = unreal.BlueprintService.add_variable(bp_path, "FinishRotatingDispatcher", "FStateTreeDelegateDispatcher")
    assert result, "Failed to add FinishRotatingDispatcher variable"
    unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
    unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)

# Step 2: Set the transition trigger to OnDelegate
result = unreal.StateTreeService.update_transition(st_path, state_path, transition_index, trigger="OnDelegate")
assert result, "update_transition failed"

# Step 3: Bind the transition to the dispatcher property
result = unreal.StateTreeService.bind_transition_to_delegate(
    st_path, state_path, transition_index,
    "STT_Rotate",                  # task name (display name, Blueprint name, or struct type)
    "FinishRotatingDispatcher"     # the FStateTreeDelegateDispatcher variable name
)
assert result, "bind_transition_to_delegate failed"

# Step 4: Compile — should now succeed with no delegate errors
compile_result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)
assert compile_result.success, compile_result.errors
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(st_path)
```

#### Firing the Dispatcher from the Blueprint Task

In `STT_Rotate`'s Blueprint graph, call the dispatcher to trigger the transition:

```python
# The dispatcher is called like a function in Blueprint — add a "Call FinishRotatingDispatcher" node
# connected to whatever execution flow should end the state (e.g. after a timer, animation, etc.)
```

#### Notes

- `FStateTreeDelegateDispatcher` is a USTRUCT — use type string `"FStateTreeDelegateDispatcher"` with `add_variable`.
- The dispatcher variable must be on the task that is **in the same state** as the `OnDelegate` transition.
- After `bind_transition_to_delegate`, the compile error about the missing binding will resolve.

### Compile & Save

```python
# Always compile after structural changes
result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
# result.success   → bool
# result.errors      → list of strings
# result.warnings    → list of strings

# Save to disk
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree("/Game/AI/MyBehavior")
```

### Setting the Context Actor Class

```python
# Pass the Blueprint ASSET path (no _C suffix) — StateTreeService resolves the generated class.
unreal.StateTreeService.set_context_actor_class("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior", "/Game/Blueprints/BP_MyActor")
unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior")
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior")
```

### Property Bindings (Binding Task Properties to Context or Parameters)

Bindings connect a task's property to a **context object** (e.g. the Actor running the StateTree) or
a **root parameter**. This is how tasks access external data at runtime.

#### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Context Must Be Set Before Binding

`bind_task_property_to_context` will **fail silently** if the StateTree has no context actor class.
Check `get_state_tree_info().context_actor_class` first — if it's empty, call `set_context_actor_class`
before attempting any context binding.

#### Full Binding Workflow

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/StateTree/ST_Cube"
state_path = "Root"
# For Blueprint tasks, use the Blueprint class name (STT_Rotate_C or STT_Rotate)
# OR "StateTreeBlueprintTaskWrapper" — both work.
task_struct = "STT_Rotate_C"

# Step 1: Check if context actor class is set
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(st_path)
print(f"Context Actor Class: {info.context_actor_class}")

# Step 2: If empty, SET IT FIRST — this is the #1 reason bindings fail
if not info.context_actor_class:
    unreal.StateTreeService.set_context_actor_class(st_path, "/Game/Blueprints/BP_Cube")
    print("Set context actor class")

# Step 3: Discover bindable properties on the task
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_task_property_names(st_path, state_path, task_struct)
for p in props:
    print(f"  {p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")

# Step 4: Bind task property to the context Actor (whole object)
#   - context_name="Actor" matches the first context descriptor (default)
#   - context_property_path="" means bind the entire actor reference
result = unreal.StateTreeService.bind_task_property_to_context(
    st_path, state_path, task_struct,
    "Cube",           # task property to bind
    "Actor",          # context name
    ""                # context property path (empty = whole object)
)
print(f"Bind result: {result}")

# Step 5: Compile and save
compile_result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)
assert compile_result.success, compile_result.errors
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(st_path)
```

#### Binding to a Root Parameter

```python
# Bind a task property to a root parameter (no context actor class needed)
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_task_property_to_root_parameter(
    st_path, state_path, task_struct,
    "Duration",        # task property
    "IdlingTime"       # root parameter name
)

# Bind a task property to a property exposed by a global task
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_task_property_to_global_task_property(
    st_path, state_path, task_struct,
    "PatrolPointManager",     # task property
    "STT_PatrolManagement",   # global task name
    "PatrolPointManager"      # global task property
)
```

#### Binding Evaluator Properties

Evaluators are global (not tied to a state), so there is no `state_path` parameter.

```python
# Bind an evaluator property to a root parameter
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_evaluator_property_to_root_parameter(
    st_path,
    "STE_PatrolPointManagement",  # evaluator struct name (or Blueprint wrapper name)
    "PatrolTag",                  # evaluator property to bind
    "PatrolTag"                   # root parameter name
)

# Bind an evaluator property to context data
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_evaluator_property_to_context(
    st_path,
    "STE_PatrolPointManagement",  # evaluator struct name
    "ActorRef",                   # evaluator property to bind
    "Actor",                      # context name
    ""                            # context property path (empty = whole object)
)

# Unbind an evaluator property
unreal.StateTreeService.unbind_evaluator_property(
    st_path,
    "STE_PatrolPointManagement",
    "PatrolTag"
)
```

### Assigning a StateTree to a StateTreeComponent on a Blueprint

`StateTreeComponent` has **two** properties that look related — only `StateTreeRef` is shown in the
editor Details panel. Always set `StateTreeRef`, never `StateTree`.

```python
# WRONG — sets the internal TObjectPtr; the Details panel still shows None
unreal.BlueprintService.set_component_property(bp_path, "StateTree", "StateTree", st_path)

# CORRECT — sets the FStateTreeReference struct that the editor reads
unreal.BlueprintService.set_component_property(bp_path, "StateTree", "StateTreeRef", st_path)
unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)
```

### Theme Colors (Global Color Table)

StateTree assets have a **global color table** — named color entries that can be assigned to states
for visual organization in the editor. These are NOT material colors or rendering colors.

When a user says "color", "rename color", "change color", or "theme color" in a StateTree context,
they mean **StateTree theme colors** (editor-only visual labels), not material parameters.

**List all theme colors:**
```python
colors = unreal.StateTreeService.get_theme_colors("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior")
for c in colors:
    print(f"{c.display_name}: R={c.color.r}, G={c.color.g}, B={c.color.b} — used by: {[s for s in c.used_by_states]}")
```

**Set a state's theme color (creates the color entry if it doesn't exist):**
```python
color = unreal.LinearColor(r=0.2, g=0.6, b=1.0, a=1.0)
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_theme_color("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior", "Root/Idle", "Idle", color)
```

**Rename a theme color entry (preserves all state references):**
```python
unreal.StateTreeService.rename_theme_color("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior", "Default Color", "Active")
```

**Workflow:** Always call `get_theme_colors` first to see what exists before renaming or modifying.

### Expand / Collapse States

Control whether states are expanded or collapsed in the editor tree view:

```python
# Collapse a state in the editor
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_expanded("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior", "Root/Walking", False)

# Expand a state
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_expanded("/Game/AI/ST_MyBehavior", "Root/Walking", True)
```

The current expand/collapse state is also returned in `get_state_tree_info` results via `b_expanded`.

### Advanced Editor Config (Use service first)

Use `unreal.StateTreeService` for StateTree asset edits first. The service layer now covers:

- List, set, and rename theme colors (`get_theme_colors`, `set_state_theme_color`, `rename_theme_color`)
- Expand/collapse states in the editor tree view (`set_state_expanded`)
- Configure state descriptions
- Add/edit StateTree parameters and default values
- Bind task properties (e.g. debug text bindable text, delay duration bindings)
- Set the context actor class

Reserve `execute_python_code` for Blueprint or level-instance operations outside the StateTree asset itself, such as:

- Adding Blueprint variables or components
- Making Blueprint properties instance-editable
- Overriding StateTree component data on placed actors

Recommended pattern:

1. Use `unreal.StateTreeService` methods for structure, descriptions, colors, parameters, property edits, bindings, compile, and save.
2. Use `execute_python_code` only for Blueprint or level-instance work that sits outside the StateTree asset.

## COMMON_MISTAKES

### ⚠️ "Color" Means Theme Color, Not Materials

When a user asks to rename, change, or list "colors" on a StateTree, they mean **theme colors** —
the editor-only color labels in the StateTree's global color table. Do NOT load the materials skill
or look for material parameters. Use `get_theme_colors`, `set_state_theme_color`, and `rename_theme_color`.

### ⚠️ Blueprint Global Tasks — Use Name/Path, Not Wrapper Type

`add_global_task` supports Blueprint tasks by name, asset path, or `_C` generated class — the same
forms as `add_evaluator`. Do NOT pass `"StateTreeBlueprintTaskWrapper"` directly; that's an internal
struct name and won't resolve to the correct Blueprint class.

```python
# WRONG — passes the raw wrapper type; the specific Blueprint class won't be set
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task(st_path, "StateTreeBlueprintTaskWrapper")

# CORRECT — any of these forms work
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task(st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task(st_path, "STT_PatrolManagement_C")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_global_task(st_path, "/Game/StateTree/Tasks/STT_PatrolManagement")
```

When inspecting or binding, use the task's display name as it appears in `get_state_tree_info().global_tasks[N].name`
(e.g. `"STT PatrolManagement"` — no underscore, no `_C`).

### ⚠️ Blueprint Task Struct Name in get_task_property_names / bind_task_property_to_context

Blueprint tasks are stored internally as `StateTreeBlueprintTaskWrapper`. When calling
`get_task_property_names`, `bind_task_property_to_context`, `set_task_property_value`, or any
other task API, you can use **any** of these names — they all resolve to the same node:

- `"STT_Rotate_C"` — the Blueprint generated class name
- `"STT_Rotate"` — the Blueprint name without `_C` suffix
- `"STT Rotate"` — the display name shown in the editor
- `"StateTreeBlueprintTaskWrapper"` — the raw struct type

`get_state_tree_info()` shows tasks as `"STT Rotate (StateTreeBlueprintTaskWrapper)"` — use
either the name part or the struct_type part.

### ⚠️ Binding Fails When Context Actor Class Is Not Set

`bind_task_property_to_context` returns `False` when the StateTree has no context actor class.
The error message will say "Context 'Actor' not found — this StateTree has NO context actor class set."

**Diagnosis:** Call `get_state_tree_info()` and check `context_actor_class`. If it's empty, no
context bindings can work.

**Fix:** Call `set_context_actor_class()` with the appropriate Blueprint actor path BEFORE binding.

```python
# WRONG — binding with no context actor class set (will always fail)
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_task_property_to_context(st_path, "Root", "STT_Rotate_C", "Cube", "Actor", "")

# CORRECT — set context first, then bind
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(st_path)
if not info.context_actor_class:
    unreal.StateTreeService.set_context_actor_class(st_path, "/Game/Blueprints/BP_Cube")
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_task_property_to_context(st_path, "Root", "STT_Rotate_C", "Cube", "Actor", "")
```

### ⚠️ Forgetting to Compile

Every structural change (add state, add task, add transition) requires recompilation.
Always call `compile_state_tree()` before `save_state_tree()`.

```python
# WRONG — changes not compiled
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "Root", "MyState")
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(path)  # saves uncompiled tree

# CORRECT
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "Root", "MyState")
result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(path)
if result.success:
    unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(path)
```

### ⚠️ Root State Must Be Created First

You cannot add child states before creating the root subtree.

```python
# WRONG — Root doesn't exist yet
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "Root", "Idle")

# CORRECT
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "", "Root")   # create Root first
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "Root", "Idle")
```

### ⚠️ Empty parentPath Creates a New Subtree

Passing an empty `parent_path` always creates a **new top-level subtree**, not a child of Root.

```python
# Creates a second top-level subtree named "Idle" (NOT under Root)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "", "Idle")   # ← wrong

# Add Idle under Root
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "Root", "Idle")  # ← correct
```

### ⚠️ GotoState Requires targetPath

Transition type "GotoState" requires a valid `target_path`. Other types do not.

```python
# WRONG — missing target for GotoState
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(path, "Root/Idle", "OnStateCompleted", "GotoState")

# CORRECT
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(path, "Root/Idle", "OnStateCompleted", "GotoState", "Root/Walking")
```

### ⚠️ NEVER Use remove_state + add_state to "Move" a State

**This is destructive and can silently drop the original state's identity and editor data.**

When asked to move a StateTree state under a different parent, always use `move_state`.
`move_state` reparents the existing `UStateTreeState` in-place, preserving its children, tasks,
transitions, bindings, and per-state metadata.

`remove_state` followed by `add_state` creates a different state object. Any data attached to the
original state can be lost or detached from the new copy.

```python
# WRONG — destroys the original state object and recreates a lookalike
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_state(path, "Root/Idle")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_state(path, "Root/Peaceful", "Idle")

# CORRECT — reparent the existing state in-place
unreal.StateTreeService.move_state(path, "Root/Idle", "Root/Peaceful")
```

If `move_state` fails, stop and inspect the tree state. Do NOT fall back to remove+add as a workaround.

### ⚠️ NEVER Use remove_transition + add_transition to "Update" a Transition

**This is destructive and silently deletes all conditions on the transition.**

When asked to change a transition's target, trigger, or type, always use `update_transition`.
`update_transition` edits the existing `FStateTreeTransition` in-place — all conditions are preserved.

`remove_transition` followed by `add_transition` creates a fresh transition with **no conditions**.
Any `StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition` or other conditions that were wired up will be permanently lost.

```python
# WRONG — destroys all conditions on the transition
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_transition(path, "Root", 0)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(path, "Root", "OnTick", "GotoState", "Root/Chasing")

# CORRECT — update in-place, conditions are preserved
unreal.StateTreeService.update_transition(path, "Root", 0, target_path="Root/Chasing")
```

**If `update_transition` returns `True` but the change doesn't appear in get_state_tree_info:**
- Compile and check again — the in-memory state is updated before compile
- Do NOT fall back to remove+add as a workaround

```python
# Verify the update was applied AFTER compiling
result = unreal.StateTreeService.update_transition(path, "Root", 0, target_path="Root/Chasing")
print(f"Update result: {result}")  # True = written to editor data

compile = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(path)
print(f"Compile: {compile.success}")

info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(path)
for s in info.all_states:
    if s.path == "Root":
        for t in s.transitions:
            print(f"  Trans: Trigger={t.trigger}, Target={t.target_state_name}, Conditions={[(c.name, c.struct_type) for c in t.conditions]}")
```

### ⚠️ add_transition Rejects Duplicates — Do NOT Retry Blindly

`add_transition` returns `False` if an identical transition (same trigger, type, and target) already
exists on the state. If compilation fails after adding a transition, do **NOT** call `add_transition`
again with different parameters — the first transition is still in memory. Instead:

1. **Remove** the failed transition with `remove_transition` first
2. **Then** add the corrected one

```python
# WRONG — retrying add_transition without removing the previous attempt
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(path, "Root", "OnTick", "NextSelectableState")  # compile fails
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(path, "Root", "OnTick", "GotoState", "Root/Idle")  # now 2 transitions!

# CORRECT — remove the failed one first, then add the corrected version
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(path, "Root", "OnTick", "NextSelectableState")  # compile fails
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_transition(path, "Root", 0)  # clean up
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition(path, "Root", "OnTick", "GotoState", "Root/Idle")  # now only 1
```

### ⚠️ Use `StateTreeRef` Not `StateTree` on StateTreeComponent

`StateTreeComponent` has two related properties. The editor Details panel reads `StateTreeRef`.
Setting `StateTree` silently succeeds but the value does not appear in the editor.

```python
# WRONG — Details panel still shows None
unreal.BlueprintService.set_component_property(bp, "StateTree", "StateTree", st_path)

# CORRECT
unreal.BlueprintService.set_component_property(bp, "StateTree", "StateTreeRef", st_path)
```

### ⚠️ Task Struct Names Include "F" Prefix

```python
# WRONG
unreal.StateTreeService.add_task(path, "Root/Idle", "StateTreeDelayTask")

# CORRECT
unreal.StateTreeService.add_task(path, "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask")
```

### ⚠️ Never Guess Task Property Names or Value Formats

`set_task_property_value` silently returns `False` when the property name or value format is wrong. Prefer the detailed result API and always:

1. Read `task.struct_type` from `get_state_tree_info()` to get the exact struct name
2. Inspect the struct's actual properties via `get_task_property_names()` before calling a setter
3. If duplicate task structs exist on the same state, pass `task_match_index` explicitly
4. Check the result object or read the value back before compiling

```python
# WRONG — guessing property names and ignoring the bool result
unreal.StateTreeService.set_task_property_value(path, "Root", "FStateTreeDebugTextTask", "Color", "(R=1.0,...)")
unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(path)  # compiles even if nothing changed

# CORRECT — inspect first, then use the detailed result API
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_task_property_names(path, "Root", "FStateTreeDebugTextTask")
for p in props:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value}")  # exact names + correct value format

result = unreal.StateTreeService.set_task_property_value_detailed(
    path, "Root", "FStateTreeDebugTextTask", "BindableText", "Hello from Root")
assert result.success, result.error_message
```

### ⚠️ Condition Properties That Require Bindings (e.g. "Object")

Conditions like `StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition` have properties that **must be bound**
to context data or event payload — setting a string value won't work. Use `bind_transition_condition_property_to_context`,
`bind_enter_condition_property_to_context`, or `bind_transition_condition_property_to_event_payload` instead of `set_*_condition_property_value`.

```python
# WRONG — trying to set "Object" as a string value (will fail or compile error)
unreal.StateTreeService.set_transition_condition_property_value(
    path, "Root", 0, "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object", "/Game/SomeActor")

# CORRECT — bind it to the context actor's property
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_transition_condition_property_to_context(
    path, "Root", 0, "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object", "Actor", "TargetPawn")

# CORRECT — bind it to the transition's event payload property
# (when the transition has a RequiredEvent with a PayloadStruct like FStartChasingPayload)
# First inspect the payload fields instead of guessing the path.
payload_props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_transition_event_payload_property_names(path, "Root", 0)
for p in payload_props:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")

# The bind helper accepts friendly field names and resolves them to the reflected path.
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_transition_condition_property_to_event_payload(
    path, "Root", 0, "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object", "TargetPawn")
```

### ⚠️ Bool Properties Drop the `b` Prefix in Python

UE Python bindings strip the `b` prefix from bool UPROPERTY names and convert to snake_case.

```python
# C++ field:     bSuccess    → Python: result.success
# C++ field:     bEnabled    → Python: state_info.enabled
# C++ field:     bIsCompiled → Python: info.is_compiled

result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(path)
print(result.success)   # NOT result.b_success or result.bSuccess
```

### ⚠️ Use `ReceiveLatentTick`, Not `ReceiveTick` on StateTree Tasks

`ReceiveTick` is **deprecated** on `StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase`. Using it causes compile errors:
> `Cannot override 'StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase::ReceiveTick' — declared with a different signature`

```python
bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/STT_MyTask"

# WRONG — deprecated, will fail to compile
unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "ReceiveTick", 0, 0)

# CORRECT — new Tick event without return value
unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "ReceiveLatentTick", 0, 0)

# WRONG — deprecated Enter State
unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "ReceiveEnterState", 0, 0)

# CORRECT — new Enter State event without return value
unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "ReceiveLatentEnterState", 0, 0)
```

## New Methods (Phase 1 & 2)

### State Properties

```python
# Set how children of a state are selected
unreal.StateTreeService.set_selection_behavior(path, "Root", "TrySelectChildrenInOrder")
# Options: "None", "TryEnterState", "TrySelectChildrenInOrder", "TrySelectChildrenAtRandom",
#          "TrySelectChildrenWithHighestUtility", "TrySelectChildrenAtRandomWeightedByUtility",
#          "TryFollowTransitions"

# Set task completion mode for a state
unreal.StateTreeService.set_tasks_completion(path, "Root/Idle", "Any")  # "Any" or "All"

# Rename a state
unreal.StateTreeService.rename_state(path, "Root/OldName", "NewName")

# Set a gameplay tag on a state (tag must exist in the project tag table)
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_tag(path, "Root/Idle", "AI.State.Idle")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_tag(path, "Root/Idle", "")  # clear the tag

# Set utility weight (for Utility-based selection behaviors)
unreal.StateTreeService.set_state_weight(path, "Root/Idle", 2.5)

# Set whether a task's completion contributes to the owning state's completion
unreal.StateTreeService.set_task_considered_for_completion(path, "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask", 0, True)
```

### Parameters (Root Property Bag)

```python
# Get all root parameters with name, type, and current default value
params = unreal.StateTreeService.get_root_parameters(path)
for p in params:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.default_value!r}")

# Also returned in get_state_tree_info:
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(path)
for p in info.root_parameters:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.default_value!r}")

# Add or update a root parameter of any primitive type
unreal.StateTreeService.add_or_update_root_parameter(path, "my_float", "Float", "3.14")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_or_update_root_parameter(path, "my_bool", "Bool", "true")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_or_update_root_parameter(path, "my_int", "Int32", "42")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_or_update_root_parameter(path, "my_string", "String", "Hello")
# Type options: "Bool", "Int32", "Int64", "Float", "Double", "Name", "String", "Text"

# Remove a root parameter by name
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_root_parameter(path, "my_float")

# Rename a root parameter (reads current value, removes old, adds under new name)
unreal.StateTreeService.rename_root_parameter(path, "old_name", "new_name")
```

### Per-Instance Parameter Overrides (Level Actors)

StateTree parameters defined on the asset are the *defaults*. Placed actors have their own
`StateTreeComponent` instance that can override each parameter value independently.

**⚠️ LOAD THIS SKILL FIRST** — Do not attempt raw discovery of StateTreeComponent parameters.
`set_component_parameter_override` handles type resolution automatically.

#### Full Discovery Workflow

When the user asks to set StateTree parameters on placed actors, follow this order:

```python
import unreal

# Step 1: Find the exact actor names in the level
actors = unreal.ActorService.list_level_actors()
for a in actors:
    print(f"{a.name}: {a.class_name}")
# Look for actors whose class_name contains your Blueprint (e.g. "BP_Cube_C")

# Step 2: Find the linked StateTree asset path for the actor
st_path = unreal.StateTreeService.get_component_state_tree_path("bp_cube1")
print(f"StateTree asset: {st_path}")
# Returns something like: /Game/StateTree/ST_Cube

# Step 3: Discover what parameters are available (names + types live in the asset)
params = unreal.StateTreeService.get_root_parameters(st_path)
for p in params:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.default_value!r}")
# Output example: IdlingTime: Float = '2.0'   RotatingTime: Float = '1.0'

# Step 4: Set per-instance overrides — type resolved automatically from the linked StateTree
unreal.StateTreeService.set_component_parameter_override("bp_cube1", "IdlingTime", "3.0")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_component_parameter_override("bp_cube1", "RotatingTime", "1.5")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_component_parameter_override("bp_cube2", "IdlingTime", "1.0")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_component_parameter_override("bp_cube2", "RotatingTime", "4.0")

# Step 5: Save the level to persist overrides
unreal.EditorLoadingAndSavingUtils.save_current_level()
```

#### Read Back Current Instance Values

```python
# Get current override values on a placed actor's StateTreeComponent
overrides = unreal.StateTreeService.get_component_parameter_overrides("bp_cube1")
for p in overrides:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.default_value!r}")
```

**Important notes:**
- The actor name must match the in-level instance label (e.g. `bp_cube1`), NOT the Blueprint
  class name. Use `ActorService.list_level_actors()` to discover exact names.
- Parameter names are defined in the StateTree asset, NOT as Blueprint variables. Always use
  `get_component_state_tree_path` + `get_root_parameters` to discover available names and types.
- Value format is identical to `add_or_update_root_parameter`: `"3.14"`, `"true"`, `"Hello"`.

### Transition Editing

```python
# Transitions are indexed 0-based within a state's transitions list.
# Use get_state_tree_info to find the index field on each FStateTreeTransitionInfo.

# Update an existing transition (pass empty string for fields you don't want to change)
unreal.StateTreeService.update_transition(
    path, "Root/Idle", 0,
    trigger="OnStateCompleted",       # empty string = no change
    transition_type="GotoState",
    target_path="Root/Walking",
    priority="Normal",
    event_tag="",                     # gameplay tag for OnEvent trigger
    event_payload_struct="",          # e.g. "FStartChasingPayload", "None" to clear
    b_set_enabled=True, b_enabled=True,
    b_set_delay=True, b_delay_transition=True, delay_duration=1.5, delay_random_variance=0.5
)

# Remove a transition by index
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_transition(path, "Root/Idle", 0)

# Reorder a transition (move from index 2 to index 0)
unreal.StateTreeService.move_transition(path, "Root/Idle", 2, 0)
```

### Task Management (Extended)

```python
# Remove a task from a state by struct type name
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_task(path, "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask")
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_task(path, "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask", 1)  # second match

# Move a task to a different index within the state's Tasks array
unreal.StateTreeService.move_task(path, "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask", 0, 2)  # move from 0 to 2

# Enable or disable a task without removing it
unreal.StateTreeService.set_task_enabled(path, "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeDelayTask", 0, False)
```

### Utility AI Considerations

Considerations drive **utility-based state selection**. When a parent state has `SelectionBehavior` set to
`TrySelectChildrenWithHighestUtility` or `TrySelectChildrenAtRandomWeightedByUtility`, each child state
has a `Considerations` array. Each consideration computes a 0–1 score; scores are multiplied together
to produce the child's final utility score.

#### The three built-in consideration types

| Short alias | Full struct name | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `"Constant"` | `FStateTreeConstantConsideration` | Static score (0–1 float) — set via `Constant` property |
| `"FloatInput"` | `FStateTreeFloatInputConsideration` | Score driven by a bound float — `Input` property must be **bound** to context or a root parameter |
| `"EnumInput"` | `FStateTreeEnumInputConsideration` | Score driven by an enum value — `Input` property must be **bound** |

Short aliases (`"Constant"`, `"FloatInput"`, `"EnumInput"`) and the full `F`-prefixed struct names are
both accepted by all consideration methods.

#### Setting up a Utility parent state

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"

# Step 1: Set the parent's selection behavior to utility-based
unreal.StateTreeService.set_selection_behavior(st_path, "Root", "TrySelectChildrenWithHighestUtility")

# Step 2: Add a Constant consideration to each child state (score = 1.0 means equal weight by default)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_consideration(st_path, "Root/Idle", "Constant")
unreal.StateTreeService.add_consideration(st_path, "Root/Walking", "Constant")

# Step 3: Set the Constant value (clamp 0–1)
unreal.StateTreeService.set_consideration_property_value(st_path, "Root/Idle", "Constant", "Constant", "0.3")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_consideration_property_value(st_path, "Root/Walking", "Constant", "Constant", "0.7")

# Step 4: Compile and save
result = unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)
assert result.success, result.errors
unreal.StateTreeService.save_state_tree(st_path)
```

#### Adding and inspecting considerations

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"
state_path = "Root/Chasing"

# Discover all registered consideration struct names
types = unreal.StateTreeService.get_available_consideration_types()
for t in types:
    print(t)  # e.g. FStateTreeConstantConsideration, FStateTreeFloatInputConsideration, ...

# Add a FloatInput consideration (Input property must later be bound)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_consideration(st_path, state_path, "FloatInput")

# Inspect properties on the just-added consideration (MatchIndex -1 = last match)
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_consideration_property_names(st_path, state_path, "FloatInput")
for p in props:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")
# Typical FloatInput output:
#   Input: float = 0.000000          ← bindable; must be bound at runtime
#   Interval: FFloatInterval          ← remaps Input range to [0,1]
#   Interval.Min: float = 0.000000
#   Interval.Max: float = 1.000000

# Remove a consideration by 0-based index
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_consideration(st_path, state_path, 0)
```

#### Check before adding — considerations accumulate

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"
state_path = "Root/Idle"

# CORRECT — check first
info = unreal.StateTreeService.get_state_tree_info(st_path)
for state in info.all_states:
    if state.path == state_path:
        existing = [c.struct_type for c in state.considerations]
        print(f"Existing considerations: {existing}")
        if not any("Constant" in s for s in existing):
            unreal.StateTreeService.add_consideration(st_path, state_path, "Constant")
            print("Added Constant consideration")
        else:
            print("Already has a Constant consideration, skipping")
```

#### Setting the Constant property

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"

# Constant consideration — set the score directly (clamp 0–1)
unreal.StateTreeService.set_consideration_property_value(
    st_path, "Root/Idle", "Constant", "Constant", "1.0")

# Multiple Constant considerations on the same state — use MatchIndex
# MatchIndex 0 = first, 1 = second, -1 = last
unreal.StateTreeService.set_consideration_property_value(
    st_path, "Root/Idle", "Constant", "Constant", "0.5", 0)  # first Constant
unreal.StateTreeService.set_consideration_property_value(
    st_path, "Root/Idle", "Constant", "Constant", "0.9", 1)  # second Constant
```

#### Binding FloatInput or EnumInput to context or a root parameter

A `FloatInput` or `EnumInput` consideration's `Input` property must be **bound** — you cannot set
a raw float value on it. Use the binding methods instead:

```python
import unreal

st_path = "/Game/AI/MyBehavior"
state_path = "Root/Chasing"

# Bind FloatInput.Input to a root parameter named "ThreatLevel"
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_consideration_property_to_root_parameter(
    st_path, state_path, "FloatInput", "Input", "ThreatLevel")

# Bind FloatInput.Input to a context actor property
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_consideration_property_to_context(
    st_path, state_path, "FloatInput", "Input",
    "Actor",           # context name
    "HealthPercent"    # context property path
)

# Unbind a consideration property
unreal.StateTreeService.unbind_consideration_property(
    st_path, state_path, "FloatInput", "Input")
```

#### ⚠️ FloatInput / EnumInput Require a Bound Input — They Cannot Be Compiled Without One

Adding a `FloatInput` or `EnumInput` consideration without binding `Input` will cause a **compile
error**. Always bind `Input` before compiling.

```python
# WRONG — FloatInput.Input is unbound; compile will fail
unreal.StateTreeService.add_consideration(st_path, state_path, "FloatInput")
unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)  # ERROR: Input is unbound

# CORRECT — bind first, then compile
unreal.StateTreeService.add_consideration(st_path, state_path, "FloatInput")
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_consideration_property_to_root_parameter(
    st_path, state_path, "FloatInput", "Input", "ThreatLevel")
unreal.StateTreeService.compile_state_tree(st_path)
```

### Conditions

```python
# Discover available condition struct names
cond_types = unreal.StateTreeService.get_available_condition_types()

# Add an enter condition to a state
unreal.StateTreeService.add_enter_condition(path, "Root/Idle", "FStateTreeCommonConditionBase")

# Remove an enter condition by index
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_enter_condition(path, "Root/Idle", 0)

# Set the And/Or operand on a condition (first must be "Copy")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_enter_condition_operand(path, "Root/Idle", 0, "Copy")
unreal.StateTreeService.set_enter_condition_operand(path, "Root/Idle", 1, "And")

# Inspect properties on an enter condition
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_enter_condition_property_names(path, "Root/Idle", "FMyCondition")
for p in props:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")

# Set a property on an enter condition
unreal.StateTreeService.set_enter_condition_property_value(path, "Root/Idle", "FMyCondition", "Threshold", "5.0")

# Add a condition to a transition (by transition index)
unreal.StateTreeService.add_transition_condition(path, "Root/Idle", 0, "FMyCondition")

# Remove a condition from a transition
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_transition_condition(path, "Root/Idle", 0, 0)  # transition 0, condition 0

# Set operand on a transition condition
unreal.StateTreeService.set_transition_condition_operand(path, "Root/Idle", 0, 1, "Or")

# Inspect properties on a transition condition
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_transition_condition_property_names(path, "Root/Idle", 0, "FMyCondition")

# Set a property on a transition condition
unreal.StateTreeService.set_transition_condition_property_value(
    path, "Root/Idle", 0, "FMyCondition", "Threshold", "3.0")

# Bind an enter condition property to context data (e.g. bind "Object" to Actor.TargetPawn)
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_enter_condition_property_to_context(
    path, "Root/Idle", "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object",
    "Actor", "TargetPawn")

# Bind an enter condition property to a property exposed by a global task
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_enter_condition_property_to_global_task_property(
    path, "Peaceful/Patrol", "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object",
    "STT_PatrolManagement", "PatrolPointManager")

# Bind a transition condition property to context data
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_transition_condition_property_to_context(
    path, "Root/Idle", 0, "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object",
    "Actor", "TargetPawn")

# Leave ContextPropertyPath empty to bind the whole context object
unreal.StateTreeService.bind_transition_condition_property_to_context(
    path, "Root", 0, "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object", "Actor")

# Bind a transition condition property to the transition's event payload
# (transition must have RequiredEvent.PayloadStruct set)
payload_props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_transition_event_payload_property_names(path, "Root/Chasing", 0)
for p in payload_props:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")

unreal.StateTreeService.bind_transition_condition_property_to_event_payload(
    path, "Root/Chasing", 0, "StateTreeObjectIsValidCondition", "Object", "TargetPawn")
```

### Evaluator & Global Task Management (Extended)

```python
# Remove a global evaluator
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_evaluator(path, "FMyEvaluator")
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_evaluator(path, "FMyEvaluator", 1)  # second match

# Inspect properties on a global evaluator
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_evaluator_property_names(path, "FMyEvaluator")
for p in props:
    print(f"{p.name}: {p.type} = {p.current_value!r}")

# Set a property on a global evaluator
unreal.StateTreeService.set_evaluator_property_value(path, "FMyEvaluator", "SomeProperty", "42.0")

# Remove a global task
unreal.StateTreeService.remove_global_task(path, "FMyGlobalTask")

# Inspect properties on a global task
props = unreal.StateTreeService.get_global_task_property_names(path, "FMyGlobalTask")

# Set a property on a global task
unreal.StateTreeService.set_global_task_property_value(path, "FMyGlobalTask", "SomeProperty", "Hello")
```

## Creating & Editing StateTree Blueprint Tasks

StateTree tasks can be written as Blueprints (`STT_*` assets, parent class `StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase`).
**Load the `blueprints` skill before doing any of the following** — `StateTreeService` cannot
edit Blueprint internals:

- Creating a new STT Blueprint
- Adding variables or components
- Overriding functions (`GetDescription`, `ReceiveLatentTick`, `ReceiveLatentEnterState`, etc.)
- Adding nodes or wiring pins in a function graph

**Always discover the exact class name first** — the same discovery pattern works for both
`create_blueprint` and `reparent_blueprint`.

### Discovery Workflow

```python
# Step 1: Discover available StateTree base classes
result = discover_python_module("unreal", name_filter="StateTreeTask")
# Review returned names — look for the blueprint-safe base class
# Typical result: "StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase" (short name used directly below)

# Step 2: Use the exact name from discovery — create_blueprint resolves it via object search
path = unreal.BlueprintService.create_blueprint(
    "STT_MyTask",               # blueprint name
    "StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase",  # exact name from Step 1
    "/Game/StateTree"           # destination folder
)
assert path, "create_blueprint returned empty — class name not found or plugin not loaded"
print(f"Created: {path}")
```

The short class name (e.g. `"StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase"`) is resolved via a full object search
across all loaded modules — the same string works for both `create_blueprint` and `reparent_blueprint`.
If `create_blueprint` returns an empty string, the class was not found.

### ⚠️ Never Guess the Parent Class — Discover First

```python
# WRONG — guessing; creates a plain Actor, not usable as a StateTree task
unreal.BlueprintService.create_blueprint("STT_MyTask", "Actor", "/Game/StateTree")

# CORRECT — discover exact name, then pass it
# discover_python_module("unreal", name_filter="StateTreeTask") → confirms "StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase"
unreal.BlueprintService.create_blueprint("STT_MyTask", "StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase", "/Game/StateTree")
```

### StateTree Task Blueprint Event Functions

When adding event nodes to a `StateTreeTaskBlueprintBase` Blueprint, use **only** the non-deprecated
function names. The deprecated versions (`ReceiveTick`, `ReceiveEnterState`) have a different
signature and cause compile errors.

| Purpose | Correct Function | WRONG (deprecated) |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|
| Tick every frame | `ReceiveLatentTick` | ~~`ReceiveTick`~~ |
| On state enter | `ReceiveLatentEnterState` | ~~`ReceiveEnterState`~~ |
| On state exit | `ReceiveExitState` | — |
| On state completed | `ReceiveStateCompleted` | — |

```python
import unreal

bp_path = "/Game/StateTree/STT_MyTask"

# Add Tick event — MUST use ReceiveLatentTick, NOT ReceiveTick
tick_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "ReceiveLatentTick", 0, 0)
print(f"Tick node: {tick_id}")

# Add Enter State event
enter_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "ReceiveLatentEnterState", 0, 200)
print(f"Enter node: {enter_id}")

# Add Exit State event
exit_id = unreal.BlueprintService.add_event_node(bp_path, "EventGraph", "ReceiveExitState", 0, 400)
print(f"Exit node: {exit_id}")

unreal.BlueprintService.compile_blueprint(bp_path)
unreal.EditorAssetLibrary.save_asset(bp_path)
```

The `ReceiveLatentTick` node pins:
- **DeltaTime** (float, output) — elapsed frame time

The `ReceiveLatentEnterState` node pins:
- **Transition** (FStateTreeTransitionResult, output) — data about the entering transition

### After Creation: Find the Registered Task Type Name

Blueprint tasks register under a `_C`-suffixed name. Use `get_available_task_types()` to find it:

```python
types = unreal.StateTreeService.get_available_task_types()
for t in types:
    if "MyTask" in t.type_name:
        print(t.type_name)  # e.g. "STT_MyTask_C"
```

### Blueprint Task Add Rule (No Wrapper-First Guidance)

- Prefer adding blueprint tasks by their registered type name (for example, `STT_Rotate_C`) via `StateTreeService.add_task`.
- Do not present `StateTreeBlueprintTaskWrapper` as the user-level task outcome when a named blueprint task type exists.
- If wrapper internals are used by the service implementation, keep that internal and report the added task as the blueprint task name.

### Extended Info Available in get_state_tree_info

`FStateTreeInfo` now includes `root_parameters` (list of `FStateTreeParameterInfo`).

`FStateTreeStateInfo` now includes:
- `tag` (str) — gameplay tag string, empty if none
